Malaysia Mining Corporation, one of the country's largest resources groups,
is proposing to buy a 45 per cent stake in National Consolidated (NCL), the
listed Australian engineering group, for about ADollars 110m (USDollars
84m).
The purchase, which is subject to various approvals, would be the latest in
a series of Australian investments taken by MMC. It already holds stakes in
Ashton Mining, the diamond mining company, and Plutonic Resources, the
goldmining and minerals exploration group.
The seller in this case is Tooth &amp; Co, an investment holding company and
part of the troubled Adsteam group. Tooth currently owns almost 49 of
National Consolidated, and proposes to retain a 3.74 per cent stake if the
MMC sale, at ADollars 1.26 a share, is approved. Adsteam itself owns a
further 17.8 per cent of National Consolidated.
The sale is subject to approval from National Consolidated and Tooth
shareholders, Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board, and Central Bank
Malaysia. Tooth has also granted MMC an option over 19.9 per cent of
National Consolidated's shares, exercisable if a third party emerges to bid
for NCL and shareholder approval for the Tooth/MMC deal is not forthcoming.
Yesterday, in a statement, MMC said that it was not 'the present intention
of MMC to launch a takeover bid for NCL but, as in the case of its other
large investments in Australian listed companies, to maintain a substantial
long term shareholding'.
The company pulled out of tin mining, previously its core activity, last
year, and has been diversifying activities. NCL returned to profit in
1993-94 after several years of losses, on a reduced sales base of just over
Dollars 200m, having sold its building materials operations in 1993.
