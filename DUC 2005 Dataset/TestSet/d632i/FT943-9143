fragile market - The challenges facing the metal's producers

The possibility that Britain's last operating tin mine - South Crofty, near
Redruth - might close down raised emotions in Cornwall but it created not a
ripple of interest elsewhere in an industry decimated over the past 10 years
by mine and smelter closures.
Those left in the industry are obsessed by one question: when will the
Chinese government gain tighter control over its recalcitrant tin miners and
stop them pouring exports into the west? These exports, they claim, are
destabilising the market and preventing tin producers from benefiting from
the improvement in world economic activity.
'We expected the tin price to reach about Dollars 6,000 a tonne by now,'
says Mr Fidelis Madavo, tin specialist at the CRU International consultancy
group. 'But here it is struggling along at Dollars 5,000 to Dollars 5,100.'
The tin market has been in turmoil since the sudden collapse in 1985 of a
price support scheme operated by the producers' International Tin Council,
which was backed by the governments. The huge stocks accumulated by the ITC
 -more than 40,000 tonnes - have been a malign influence on prices ever
since.
Tin had already been struggling in the early 1980s because a big chunk of
its market - for beverage cans - was being won away by aluminium producers.
This trend started in North America, where aluminium's share of the beverage
can market has risen from 15 per cent in 1973 to 93 per cent, and it has
been a growing threat in other industrialised countries too. Also thinner
coatings of tin are being used on tin-plated steel cans.
Nor have the metal's main other uses been particularly buoyant. Its use in
solders, now the principal application, increased throughout the 1980s as
did its use in chemicals. But in 1993 tin consumption was 30 per cent below
its peak 20 years previously.
In an effort to whittle away the former ITC stocks, a group of producers
formed the Association of Tin Producing Countries - its aim to voluntarily
restrict exports. The scheme has not worked well. Unexpected and
unrestrained exports from Brazil - not a member of the ATPC - caused havoc
in the early years.
Then China, now the world's biggest producer, continued to pump large
quantities of the metal into export markets. The collapse of the former
Soviet Union, once a substantial consumer of tin, added to the producers'
difficulties.
Today the ATPC faces its greatest challenge because after much persuasion
China joined in April this year. But it has flagrantly been exceeding its
export quota.
China agreed to limit its tin exports in 1994 to 20,000 tonnes. The official
China Daily reported at the beginning of this month that in the first half
alone the country exported 24,700 tonnes, a 33 per cent increase on the same
months of 1993. 'The ATPC is a toothless tiger and should be disbanded,'
said one analyst, reflecting a widely-held view in the industry.
The China Daily also reported that the Chinese government would tighten up
on tin exports in the second half of this year. It did not, however, say
how.
'Do the authorities really have control over shipments?' says Mr Andy Shaw,
tin specialist at the Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services consultancy group.
'China has said it will adhere to certain ATPC recommended limits on exports
in previous years even though it has not been a member, but of course it
hasn't'
Mr Shaw suggests that, if it had not been for China's exports of refined tin
during the past few years, 'the stocks overhang which was left as a legacy
of the collapse of the International Tin Council could have been more or
less drawn down by now'.
CRU's Mr Madavo expects China's refined tin exports to slow in the second
half of this year but the 1994 total will probably exceed the 32,000-33,000
tonnes exported last year. China also ships out tin in concentrate (an
intermediate material) and, when this is taken into account, the export
total could rise to 40,000-45,000 tonnes.
'Traditional tin producers are being forced to deliver their metal into
London Metal Exchange warehouse,' Mr Madavo says. LME stocks, which totalled
20,000 tonnes at the end of last year, have climbed to 30,000 tonnes.
And, where CRU was earlier forecasting that western world demand for tin
would outpace supply this year, it now seems there will be a supply surplus.
Consumption is forecast to rise by just over 1 per cent, from 168,000 tonnes
last year to 170,000 tonnes and, while western world production is expected
to shrink from 141,000 tonnes to 135,000 tonnes, that would not be enough to
allow Chinese exports to be easily absorbed. The market also has to cope
with steady selling from the US strategic stockpile which disposed of 6,900
tonnes last year.
Nevertheless, analysts tend to be relatively bullish about tin's longer-term
prospects.
The International Tin Research Institute recently suggested that demand
could be boosted by 20 per cent within five years with a number of new
applications due to reach the market soon.
These include a tin-zinc alloy for plating car components; inorganic tin
compounds for fire-retardant packaging; lead-free tin alloy for gunshot;
antimony-tin solders with a higher tin content than present lead-tin
solders; and tin bottle capsules, used instead of lead.
On top of this, British Steel has announced that its 'Ultimate Can' for
beverages is ready for commercial production. This can, developed with other
European tinplate producers, is said to be 30 per cent cheaper than its
aluminium equivalent.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group, says: 'We are cautiously optimistic about the
prospects for tin demand over the next decade.
'The decline in consumption in tinplate has run its course even before we
consider the implications of the Ultimate Can. But, if producers are to
enjoy the benefits of higher demand, when it eventually arrives, they must
act to reduce stocks.'
