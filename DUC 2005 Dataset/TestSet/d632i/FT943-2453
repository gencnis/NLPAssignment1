Rumours have been emerging from Bangkok, where the Association of Tin
Producing Countries is holding a ministerial meeting today and tomorrow,
that the producers are ready to abandon the export quota system which they
had hoped would reduce global stocks and boost prices.
If this happens, there might be a short-term negative reaction on the London
Metal Exchange, according to Mr Fidelis Madavo, tin specialist at the CRU
International consultancy group, but the price can be expected to stabilise
quickly.
The tin market has been in turmoil since the sudden collapse in 1985 of a
price support scheme operated by the producers' International Tin Council,
which was backed by various governments. The huge stocks accumulated by the
ITC - more than 40,000 tonnes - have been a malign influence on prices ever
since.
Tin had already been struggling in the early 1980s because a big chunk of
its market - for beverage cans - was being won away by aluminium producers.
Nor have the metal's other main uses, such as in solders, been particularly
buoyant.
The quota scheme operated by the Association of Tin Producing Countries has
not worked well. Unexpected and unrestrained exports from Brazil - not a
member of the organisation - caused havoc in the early years. Then China,
the world's biggest producer, pumped large quantities of the metal into
export markets.
In April China finally agreed to join the ATPC. But it has flagrantly been
exceeding its 1994 export quota of 20,000 tonnes. The official China Daily
reported at the beginning of August that in the first half of 1994 alone
China exported 24,700 tonnes, up 33 per cent on the same months of 1993.
There have been suggestions that Brazil, the only big producer still outside
the ATPC might join next year. But some analysts suggest that, given China's
recent performance, rather than bringing Brazil into the fold, the ATPC
should be folded.
