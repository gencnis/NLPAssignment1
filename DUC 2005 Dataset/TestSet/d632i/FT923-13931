FT  10 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Much tin capacity 'still
unprofitable'

TIN PRICES have risen by more than 25 per cent since the begining of this
year but even so about a third of the industry's production capacity was
still unprofitable, Mr Campbell Anderson, managing director of Renison
Goldfields Consolidated, the Australian mining group, pointed out yesterday.
The recent price rise 'probably has gone too high too quickly', and was
likely to stabilise before moving up again, he suggested. 'But I'm
reasonably bullish about tin.'
Mr Anderson warned that there was still a great deal of production capacity
that could be brought back into operation at little cost if prices continued
to rise. However, the Malaysian government had recently said tin was no
longer strategically important so was unlikely to subsidise the re-start of
dredgers there.
Renison last year came close to closing its tin mine on Tasmania's west
coast - the world's only underground tin mine - because of low prices.
Employees agreed to a productivity scheme which cut the workforce by 100 to
250 with the aim of sustaining annual output at about 6,000 tonnes of tin
but reducing production costs to Dollars 6,500 a tonne. In fact, costs had
been reduced to about Dollars 5,500, said Mr Anderson, who was speaking to
the Association of Mining Analysts in London.
Tin averaged Dollars 2.52 a lb last year (Dollars 5,556 a tonne) and
analysts have been revising their forecasts for 1992 in response to the
metal's strong price performance so far. Mr Nick Moore at Ord Minnett
suggests the price will move up to an average of Dollars 3 a lb this year
and to Dollars 3.80 in 1993. Mr Robin Bhar, consultant to Carr Kitcat &amp;
Aitken, looks for Dollars 2.85 a lb this year and Dollars 2.95 next year.
