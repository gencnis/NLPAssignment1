INDONESIA CAPTURED from Brazil last year top place among the world's tin
producers, according to an analysis in the latest Metals and Minerals annual
review.
It suggests that in south-east Asia 'Indonesia was alone in staging an
attempt to ensure the longer-term survival of domestic tin mining'.
The author, Mr Andrew Shaw of Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services, adds:
'The evidence so far suggests that this attempt has been partly successful'.
He points out that local producer PT Tambang Timah's cost-cutting programme
and a productivity drive at Koba, owned by Renison Goldfields Consolidated
of Australia, restricted Indonesia's output decline while putting the
country among the lowest-cost producers. In contrast, Brazil's output
suffered because activity at the rich Bom Futuro operation in Rondonia was
severely curtailed.
Tin mine output outside the former eastern bloc last year was at its lowest
since 1959 at 137,100 tonnes, down from 158,100 tonnes in 1990. But
Indonesia held production at 30,100 tonnes compared with 31,700 tonnes in
1990. Meanwhile, Brazil's output fell from 39,100 tonnes to 29,300 tonnes.
