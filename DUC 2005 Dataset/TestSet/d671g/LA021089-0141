$100,000 IN TOYS, GIFTS ARRIVE FOR NEEDY YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A truck filled with about $100,000 worth of toys and gifts to be distributed to 
needy children in the county pulled into the Anaheim Plaza on Thursday 
afternoon, courtesy of a prison inmate and a toy company. 
</P>
<P>
The delivery of gifts, which will be distributed by local social service 
agencies, was arranged by Rick Rowe, who is serving a life sentence in a New 
Jersey state prison for kidnaping. New Jersey-based Russ Berrie Co. Inc. 
donated the toys. 
</P>
<P>
The Thursday delivery from the company's Anaheim division was one of two 
scheduled shipments, said Steve Swaim, manager of community services for the 
city of Anaheim. A truck with a second shipment from the San Francisco Bay Area 
had a flat tire and was delayed. It probably will arrive Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The two shipments are worth more than $200,000, said Robert Kundee, a general 
manager of Russ Berrie. Transportation was arranged by the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
The toy shipment is the second such donation to local Anaheim agencies by Rowe 
and Russ Berrie. The last one was at Christmastime. 
</P>
<P>
The toys will go to Salvation Army offices in Orange County, the Indian Center 
of Orange County and the Orangewood Children's Home. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe has been in prison for 15 years and will be eligible for parole for the 
first time later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe, who is the founder of the Juvenile Awareness Program, the controversial 
prison encounter sessions featured in the award-winning film "Scared Straight," 
denied Thursday that parole is a motivation for his project. 
</P>
<P>
"I had 24 hours of nothing to do," he said. "It helped me keep my sanity."
