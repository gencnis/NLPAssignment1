METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SALVATION ARMY GIVEN GRANT TO SHELTER 
FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A $100,000 grant -- the largest ever given by the Glendale Community Foundation 
-- has been awarded to the Salvation Army to help establish the first shelter 
for homeless families in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old nonprofit group recently allocated the grant toward purchase of 
the Booth House, a private residence on Chester Street that the Salvation Army 
plans to convert into a temporary shelter for displaced families. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale City Council last month allocated $200,000 in federal grant money 
for the Booth House. The Salvation Army will use the foundation grant in paying 
the balance of the $460,000 purchase price at the close of escrow June 26. The 
shelter is expected to open in September. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Miller, executive director of the community group, said the foundation 
typically awards grants of under $10,000. He said the unusually large grant was 
made at the request of a member who donated his own funds for the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the donor, who asked to remain anonymous, is a longtime trustee of 
the foundation.
