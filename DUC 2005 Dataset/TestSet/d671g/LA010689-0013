 SHELTER TO HOUSE ARMORY'S HOMELESS

</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Bell Homeless Shelter for the next three days will provide shelter to 
between 50 and 75 homeless people who lost their emergency quarters when the 
California National Guard armory in Long Beach became unavailable, officials 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Salvation Army Capt. David Hudson, administrator of the Bell shelter, said a 
Los Angeles County official asked him to make room for the extra people from 
Long Beach. Hudson said the 18,000-square-foot facility, a remodeled federal 
warehouse, is already providing shelter to about 230 people. But if the weather 
continues to be rainy and cold, the shelter's ranks could swell to more than 
300, he said.

<P>
Los Angeles County officials have been informed that the National Guard plans 
to use the Long Beach armory for routine drills on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Under a state program, the armories normally are given over to the homeless 
whenever temperatures drop below 40 degrees in dry weather and 50 degrees in 
rainy weather.
