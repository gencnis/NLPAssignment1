FT  14 DEC 93 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (7): The
Salvation Army
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
More than a century after the Salvation Army began its work among the
homeless and destitute, the need for its services remains strong. The army
adopted Strategy for Change, a reappraisal of its services for London's
homeless, two years ago; its recommendations are currently being
implemented. These involve a Pounds 35m upgrading of all the army's existing
facilities for the homeless in the capital.
Breaking the cycle of homelessness is central to the new approach.
Self-containing flats will be provided to enable hostel residents to move
into long-term accommodation, while Salvation Army social workers and
volunteers have been trained in outreach work to make contact with homeless
people on the streets.
The success of such work depends on a regular flow of income from charitable
appeals, and this year has been a fraught one for the Salvation Army. It
announced in the spring that it had lost about Pounds 6m 'through the
fraudulent activities of third parties.' Police investigations, legal action
to recover money, and inquiries by the Charity Commissioners are all
continuing.
The events have not yet had a serious impact on the Salvation Army's
fundraising - perhaps because its strong social service record is so
established in the public mind - but such incidents send shudders through
the voluntary sector. Although charity managers point out that even banks
sometimes fall victim to fraud, they recognise that a single problem is
likely to enhance the perception among some sections of the public that
charities are run by amateurs.
For this and other reasons large charities are giving increasing priority to
ensuring that they have professional management structures.
