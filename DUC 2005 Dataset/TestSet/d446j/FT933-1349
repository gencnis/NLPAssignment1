FT  24 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Answer to violent crime in US

<TEXT>
Sir, As an American expatriate living in Paris, I am often asked: 'Are the
United States as dangerous as they seem?' Unfortunately there is no denying
the statistics. The recent attention given by the media to violent crime
against tourists ('Florida struggles to limit damage to tourist industry',
September 16) only highlights events that have been dramatically increasing
for years.
The measures being implemented by the state of Florida will only temporarily
stem the flow; it must be realised that until we elect an administration
willing to confront the powers of the National Rifle Association and
restrict the rise of handguns, nothing will change in the short term.
Loss estimates for Florida's tourist industry are running close to Dollars
1bn. Perhaps this will hit the legislators most effectively - in their
pockets.
