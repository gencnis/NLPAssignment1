FT  07 FEB 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Trouble spots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Visitors to Egypt are advised to take special care following new threats of
violence by Islamic extremists. Seven foreigners have died and many more
been wounded in attacks in Upper Egypt and Cairo.
Visitors should avoid the Assiut and Dairut areas and behave and dress
discreetly.
Street crime is on the increase in Venezuela, particularly in Caracas,
Maracay, Valencia and Maracaibo. Travellers should use official taxis,
although the metro and buses in Caracas are generally safe. Taxi tickets can
be bought in the terminal of Caracas International Airport.
Public sector unions in Portugal plan another 24-hour strike on February 11.
