The International Federation of Tour Operators (Ifto) is to ask Kenya to
establish a tourist police force in an attempt to reduce crime against
visitors, Michael Skapinker writes. The call follows a number of widely
publicised attacks on tourists in Kenya which, tour operators say, have led
to a fall in bookings.
Ifto, which represents tour operators in 17 countries, hopes to send a
delegation to Kenya at the end of this month to discuss improving safety for
tourists. Ifto will also ask for stricter licensing of drivers involved in
the tourist industry.
