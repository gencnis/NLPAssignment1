Egyptian security forces yesterday rounded up more than 30 suspected Islamic
militants in Hurghada, 500km south of Cairo, following an attack by two
gunmen late on Tuesday in which a German tourist and two Egyptians were shot
dead.
A second German shot in the attack was said yesterday to be 'stable' after a
bullet was removed from his stomach. Witnesses said two men drew up in a
lorry, then opened fire with automatic weapons on a group of tourists in
Hurghada's market, before fleeing into an adjacent residential area.
The attack has raised fears of a renewed campaign by Islamic militants
against tourist targets following a five-month lull - the result largely of
a tough and concerted security operation which the Egyptian government
claimed had broken the back of militant Islamic groups.
Egypt's Red Sea resorts until now have been free of incidents throughout the
Gamaa al-Islamiyya's two-year-old campaign to put pressure on the government
by ruining the tourism industry.
The attack comes at a damaging time for tourism, which had begun a revival,
aided by the peaceful passage in Cairo of the recent International
Conference on Population and Development.
