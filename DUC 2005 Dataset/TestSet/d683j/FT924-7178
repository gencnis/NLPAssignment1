THE FINAL constitutional hurdle in the way of the smooth dissolution of the
Czechoslovak federation was cleared yesterday. The Czech and Slovak
republican parliaments passed a joint resolution authorising the split into
two independent republics from next January 1.
The passing of the resolution ends months of wrangling and uncertainty over
how the federation should be dissolved, with a majority of deputies in the
federal parliament holding out for a referendum on the division of the
federal state.
Yesterday's resolution is expected to be endorsed by the federal parliament,
however, thus ruling out a referendum.
The resolution was passed by 106-67 in the Czech parliament and by 73-16 in
the Slovak parliament.
Also yesterday, Mr Vaclav Havel, Czechoslovakia's former president,
confirmed that he would be a candidate for the post of president of the
Czech republic after January 1. 'I am aware of my responsibility for the
political situation in this country and I want to influence it,' he said.
According to an opinion poll published earlier this month, 57 per cent of
Czechs would like Mr Havel to become their president after the split. The
next most popular politician, Mr Vaclav Klaus, prime minister, polled only 5
per cent.
Mr Havel has so far said that he favours a direct presidential election in
the Czech republic, but members of the ruling Czech coalition have expressed
their support for a parliamentary vote, which could take place next spring.
The Czech parliament is currently discussing a draft constitution for the
republic which would limit the presidential powers, making the post largely
ceremonial.
