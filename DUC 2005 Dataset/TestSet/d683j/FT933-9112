AN ESTIMATED 100,000 ethnic Slovaks, most of them living in the Czech
Republic, have applied to relinquish their citizenship since Czechoslovakia
broke into separate states, a Slovak official said yesterday, Reuter reports
from Bratislava. Some 500 a day applied last month, she said, but the figure
was now falling.
Under Czech regulations, Slovaks with two years' residence in the Czech
Republic have until the end of this year to trade in their Slovak passports
for Czech ones, a swap that requires formally giving up their Slovak
nationality. Only a few hundred Czechs have applied for Slovak citizenship.
The Czech Republic has one of Europe's lowest unemployment rates - 2.5 per
cent - and a bustling economy. Slovakia, in contrast, has slid further into
decline since partition.
