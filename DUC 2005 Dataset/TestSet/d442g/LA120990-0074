Larry Ogletree doesn't think of himself as a hero. 
</P>
<P>
The Evans, Ga., man said he was just doing what he hopes anyone would do when 
he chased a runaway car, dodged traffic and stopped an oncoming 18-wheeler to 
rescue a 2-year-old boy inside the car. 
</P>
<P>
"If one of my sons were in a life-threatening situation, whether it be that or 
anything, I would want somebody to do the same thing," said Ogletree, general 
manager for the American National Insurance Cos. office in Augusta and the 
father of three boys, ages 12, 7 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
Ogletree, 40, had just turned onto a busy five-lane highway in suburban 
Martinez on his way to work Aug. 8, 1989, when he spotted the silver compact 
car rolling out of a convenience store parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"It just didn't look normal," he said. "There was something wrong. The wheels 
weren't turning or anything. Then I saw the child's head in the back of the 
car." 
</P>
<P>
He also saw a woman, later identified as the child's mother, standing in the 
parking lot screaming. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, I knew what was happening," Ogletree said. 
</P>
<P>
He jumped the median in his own car and parked, then began chasing the runaway 
car, which was traveling diagonally across traffic headed into the path of the 
oncoming tractor-trailer rig. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked up at the 18-wheeler," Ogletree said. "His and my eyes met. He just 
understood and he, of course, applied his brakes. He was about 10 feet from the 
car. I was running the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
Ogletree finally got close enough to grab the driver's side of the car, which 
was open. "I threw myself into it. I had ahold of the steering wheel and 
applied the brakes. The child was calm until I hit the brakes. Then he started 
crying. He was in a safety seat." 
</P>
<P>
Ogletree, who escaped with only scarred shins, said he believes the boy's 
sister accidentally hit the gearshift when she got out of the car, allowing the 
car to roll. 
</P>
<P>
The mother thanked him but implored him not to release her name or the names of 
her children, a request that he has honored. 
</P>
<P>
Ogletree said he didn't fully grasp what might have happened until that night, 
when he went to pick up his two younger boys at a day-care center adjacent to 
the convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that at that point it kind of came over me I might not have been there 
to pick them up. It was very emotional," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Spears, an insurance agent in a competing firm, has known Ogletree more 
than 10 years and said he wasn't surprised by his actions. 
</P>
<P>
"He's that kind of a fellow," Spears said. "He is not one that sits on the 
sidelines. He is a doer, a mover, a shaker. If you go into a fight, you want 
him to be behind you." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of us were prepared for the fact that someone would have the 
courage to do what he did," said Carol Shearer, a volunteer at the Columbia 
County Humane Society.
