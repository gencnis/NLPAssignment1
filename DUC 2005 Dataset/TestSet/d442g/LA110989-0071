</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven motorists who saved the lives of four people trapped in a burning car on 
the freeway will receive community service awards from the California Highway 
Patrol today. 
</P>
<P>
They are Alvin Daniels, 32, Rancho Cucamonga; Roger Middleton, 35, Alhambra; 
Raul Mata, 30, West Covina; Alfonso Alvarado Jr., 20, Los Angeles; Richard 
Marshall, 26, San Bernardino; Salvador Araujo, 37, Los Angeles, and Pete Mena, 
30, West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
The seven were in separate vehicles when they witnessed a two-car collision 
July 6 blocking three eastbound lanes of the San Bernardino Freeway in West 
Covina, said CHP spokesman Trany Morton. 
</P>
<P>
They rushed to the accident and pulled five people from one of the cars, which 
had burst into flames, Morton said. The occupants of the second car had 
apparently managed to get out on their own, he said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the victims died later of internal injuries. But Morton said the seven 
Good Samaritans saved the lives of Maria Godinez, 30, Pomona; her daughter, 
Yesenia, 12; her son, Rogelio, 6, and another passenger, Rosa Palamino, 15.
