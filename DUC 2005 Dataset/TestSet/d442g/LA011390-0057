Jona H. Taylor, 87, a retired bakery company founder who twice risked his life 
to rescue neighbors whose homes were ablaze in Leisure World Laguna Hills.

In the first instance in January, 1967, Taylor suffered serious burns while 
rushing five times into nearby homes to pull three residents to safety after 
two Marine Corps jets had crashed. In April, 1968, two days after being honored 
in Orange County for the first exploit, he pulled a woman from a house fire 
started by a burning cigarette. Afterward he was nominated for a Carnegie Hero 
Fund award. In Laguna Hills on Sunday.
