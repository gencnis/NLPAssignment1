An Orange County California Highway Patrol officer who pulled a Seal Beach 
police officer from a burning squad car has been awarded the Medal of Valor, 
California's highest honor for its employees. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Michael Bernardin, assigned to the CHP's Westminster office, was one of 
six CHP officers given the award in a Sacramento ceremony on Friday, CHP 
spokesman Sam Haynes said. 
</P>
<P>
The other recipients are state traffic officers Robert Welch, assigned to the 
Fresno area; Jeffrey Jones, the Indio area; Matthew Causie, the Ventura area; 
Javier Rocha, the San Francisco area; and John Meaders, the Verdugo Hills area. 
</P>
<P>
The Medal of Valor is given for an extraordinary act of heroism by a state 
employee, undertaken at great risk in an effort to save human life. 
</P>
<P>
Since the medal was first awarded, in 1959, it has gone to 67 members of the 
California Highway Patrol, including those honored today. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardin earned the honor for bravery during an Aug. 23, 1988, traffic 
accident involving an unidentified Seal Beach police officer. 
</P>
<P>
When Bernardin arrived at the scene, he found the unconscious officer trapped 
inside his burning squad car. Bernardin tried to douse the flames with a fire 
extinguisher but, after that attempt, he enlisted the help of two citizens to 
try to pull the victim out of the burning vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the screams of witnesses trying to warn him stay away from the intense 
heat, Bernardin cut the seat belt loose and dragged the officer to safety. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 seconds later, the police car was engulfed in flames. 
</P>
<P>
The Seal Beach officer later died from massive head injuries. Bernardin 
suffered minor smoke inhalation, but had no lasting injuries. JAMES M. GOMEZ
