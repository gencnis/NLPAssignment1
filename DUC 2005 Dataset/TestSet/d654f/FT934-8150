added value; Boys catch up with girls after 16

WHY DO some schools perform better than others?
'Raw' examination results in themselves are not enough to show how well a
school is performing.
Sir Ron Dearing, who heads the quango in charge of the national curriculum
and testing, has been asked to examine methods of measuring 'value added' -
the extent to which pupils have improved when they leave a school, compared
with when they started.
All the experimental 'value-added' projects so far carried out show much
more narrow differences between school performance than the 'raw' league
tables.
Some schools also shift position substantially. But all reveal that a
school's management and teaching can significantly affect its standing.
Several factors determine performance in the main league tables:
Selectivity
Grammar schools, whose pupils have had to pass an exam at the age of 11 or
12 to gain entrance, ought to perform better in league tables than
comprehensives - otherwise the 11-plus exams would have been disastrous.
Some comprehensive school catchment areas also tend to have more
academically able children than others - for example, Cherwell school in
north Oxford, a top performer at A-level, teaches the children of many
university lecturers.
Gender
This is controversial, but girls develop at a different rate from boys, and
educational evidence suggests that they are more intellectually mature at
the age of 16, when GCSEs are taken. Boys then catch up, and the differences
between the genders is much less marked at the point when A-levels are
taken.
This year 55 per cent of girls' school pupils passed five GCSEs at O-level
grades, compared with only 48 per cent of boys at boys' schools. A study of
London schools by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities found that
girls scored 2.6 more GCSE points on average than boys - equivalent to a C
rather than an F in one exam.
Family backgrounds and social conditions
As the table on the opposite page shows, the correlation between social
deprivation and academic performance at the level of local education
authorities is so close that the problem of academic underperformance might
almost be labelled a social one. School management
This is variable which schools can do most about. And it makes a difference.
Professor John Howson, professor of education at Oxford Brookes University,
pointed to the sometimes marked disparity between boys' and girls' grammar
schools at A-level, when gender is a negligible issue. Their social
catchment areas are identical and selection is determined for them by local
authorities.
Most such schools perform similarly. But this year's government survey shows
repeated differences - for example in Tunbridge Wells, Kent the girls'
grammar averaged 18.2 A-level points this year (20.1 last year), compared
with 12.4 at the boys' grammar (13.1 last year).
In Bournemouth, Dorset, however, the boys' school averaged 22 points
compared with 15.4 at the girls' school.
Dr Howson said these disparities could be explained only by differences in
the schools' management. He said: 'It doesn't matter whether a school's
management is very democratic, or quite autocratic, as long as everyone is
working together.'
