Girls' schools dominate this year's performance in GCSE examinations by
independent schools.
When schools were ranked by the proportion of GCSEs - the main examinations
for 16-year-olds in England and Wales - resulting in a pass at grades A to C
(equivalent to an old O-level pass), 18 of the top 20 schools were for girls
only. When ranked according to their proportion of A-grades, girls' schools
were similarly dominant, accounting for 17 of the top 20.
A total of 47.7 per cent of entries in girls' schools scored an A grade,
compared with 39.6 per cent for independent schools as a whole.
They enjoyed even greater success in the starred-A grade, introduced this
year to recognise outstanding achievement. It was awarded to 2.9 per cent of
all GCSE entries nationally, including the state sector, but to 9.9 per cent
of entries from independent schools. At Withington Girls' School in
Manchester 44.5 per cent of GCSEs entered resulted in a starred-A.
Mrs Margaret Kenyon, headmistress of Withington Girls' and president of the
Girls' Schools Association, said: 'Girls flourish in girls' schools.'
Overall, the disparity between GCSE performance in independent and
state-sector schools appears to have widened since last year. In private
schools, according to figures provided by the Independent Schools
Information Service (Isis), 39.6 per cent of entries were graded A or
better, up from 37.8 per cent last year. The figure for all schools is 13.2
per cent, up from 12.7 per cent last year.
Independent school pupils enjoyed more success in gaining at least a
C-grade, with 89.4 per cent of entries achieving this level, compared with
53.1 per cent for the nation as a whole. Isis also revealed that candidates
had taken an average of 9.1 subjects each, rebutting allegations that
schools were stopping pupils from entering in their weaker subjects to boost
their league table standings.
Mr Vivian Anthony, secretary of the Headmasters' Conference, which
represents the most prestigious independent boys' and mixed schools, said
the results showed girls performed much better academically than boys at 16.
He suggested, however, that the figures did not prove that girls performed
better in a single-sex environment. He pointed out that boys' performance
was roughly equal to that of girls at A-level, which most pupils in the
independent sector regard as more important than GCSEs because they are used
to determine university places.
