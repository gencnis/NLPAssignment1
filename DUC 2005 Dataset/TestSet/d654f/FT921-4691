MANY of England's famous public schools emerge well down the list of
academic achievement, according to the FT-500 survey of independent schools
published today.
Seven of the top 12 independent schools in England and Wales are former
direct-grant schools, which used to award a proportion of their places to
state-funded students until the last Labour government abolished the scheme.
The FT-500, one of the most comprehensive surveys of independent education
in Britain yet published, ranks schools by an analysis of last year's
A-level results. It also details fee levels and gives performance indicators
such as the percentage of students going on to higher education.
Two Birmingham schools head the list - King Edward's (for boys) and King
Edward VI (for girls), closely followed by Portsmouth High. Winchester, in
fourth place, is the leading public school.
The survey gives a boost to day and single-sex schools. Only one school in
the top 30 is co-educational - and that just in the sixth form. Only two of
the top 12 are predominantly boarding.
Impressive standards are achieved at the top: within the leading 20, pupils
secure an average A-level grade of B. But less than a third of pupils take
three A-levels on the maths and science side.
Across the whole survey, average boarding fees are Pounds 8,126 a year, and
day fees Pounds 4,483.
