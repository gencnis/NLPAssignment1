A friend of mine said recently, "I'm thinking of getting back into flower 
gardening. Where do I start?" 
</P>
<P>
First, start with a small plot of land -- say, no more than 100 square feet. A 
10-by-10-foot square produces 100 square feet, but a plot with such dimensions 
would be hard to maintain because you couldn't reach the center without walking 
on the soil. 
</P>
<P>
And a cardinal rule of good gardening is to avoid walking on, and thus 
compacting, garden soil. Better to design a long, narrow bed, with dimensions 
such as 4-by-25 feet. 
</P>
<P>
No garden in California can flourish without an efficient irrigation system. 
One of my neighbors tried for years to grow flowers, planting them hopefully 
each spring, just before her mother came to visit. But each year they fizzled 
out after mother left. Main problem? Insufficient water. Sooner or later, a 
gardener who relies solely upon hand watering will fail. 
</P>
<P>
Overhead sprinklers work well when plants are small. However, as plants grow 
tall and bloom, the flowers are knocked over by the water from the sprinklers. 
I've started to use irrigation hoses called "leaky pipe." These hoses lie on 
the surface of the soil (or can be buried just below) and ooze water to the 
root area. 
</P>
<P>
After assuring water, get the soil ready for digging. It's usually best to 
water the target area a few days before you plan to dig. Moist, but not soggy 
soil is easiest to turn over. 
</P>
<P>
But how do you know whether your soil is too soggy to dig? Use the hand-squeeze 
test. Soil is ready to dig if a handful crumbles when squeezed; if instead it 
makes a dense ball, wait for it to dry somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
Next, a step that many gardeners underestimate: use organic soil amendment in 
preparing the soil. The least expensive is redwood amendment or redwood 
compost; these additives improve any soil, whether it's clay or sandy. Be sure 
that the amendment you choose has been either composted (allowed to break down 
naturally) or nitrolized (had nitrogen added). 
</P>
<P>
Even though my own garden soil is excellent loam, I add many bags of KRA 
organic amendment or Bandini soil builder each time I plant. Because of my 
intensive flower growing, the soil needs to be regularly replenished. For a 
100-square-foot plot, use four 3-cubic foot bags of amendment. Spread the 
amendment on the top of the soil before you turn it over. 
</P>
<P>
Fertilizer should also be added at this time. Choose a granulated fertilizer 
that contains some phosphorus, because this element does not filter through the 
soil. If you don't place it in the root zone, it can't be added later when the 
plants are growing. Use as much as the package directions suggest for a 
100-foot area, and spread it evenly on top of the soil. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the fun. Spading a garden -- if it's small and if you spread the task 
over a couple of days -- is one of life's genuine pleasures. Turn over the soil 
to a depth of 9 or 10 inches, working in the amendment and fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
For particularly hard soil, you may wish to dig twice, first to loosen the soil 
and then to mix in the soil amendment and fertilizer. When you finish, the soil 
should be loose and fluffy. 
</P>
<P>
After the soil has settled, select plants from the nursery. Smaller plants in 
pony packs and six-packs are better than quart- or gallon-sized containers. 
Even though they take longer to bear their first flowers, smaller plants 
produce more total flowers in a season -- because of their well-developed root 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
And smaller plants don't dry out as quickly as the roots of larger plants that 
are concentrated in a small area. Moreover, smaller plants are easier to plant 
and they're much cheaper than larger plants. 
</P>
<P>
Apply a diluted liquid fertilizer two weeks after planting and again about 
every four weeks during the growing season. To control weeds and keep the soil 
moist, spread a 1-inch layer of organic amendment around the plants as a mulch. 
</P>
<P>
What kind of plants to grow depends upon what you want: a cutting garden, a 
kitchen garden combining vegetables and flowers, a perennial border or an 
annual display. I like maximum color and flowers for vases; hence I choose 
fast-blooming annuals and perennials. Some of my spring favorites are blue 
salvia, Shasta daisies, coreopsis, larkspur, dianthus and annual phlox. 
</P>
<P>
The important thing, though, is to know what you are getting. Don't expect a 
gallon-sized, fully blooming foxglove that is resplendent at the nursery, for 
example, to continue blooming throughout the season once you plant it. It 
won't. Foxgloves, and many other perennials, should be planted in the fall for 
color in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Ask questions when you shop. You'll generally get good advice from garden 
center specialists regarding appropriate plant choices.
