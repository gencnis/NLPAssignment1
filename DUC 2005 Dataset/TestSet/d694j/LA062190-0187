COMPOSTING GREEN WASTE IS THE NEXT STEP IN HOUSEHOLD RECYCLING TO SAVE LANDFILL

You've already begun to recycle. Aluminum cans are money all of a sudden, and 
glass, plastic and paper are catching up. You like recycling. You feel 
virtuous. 
</P>
<P>
What's next, then? Answer: the other half of your curbside trash -- yard waste, 
or green waste. Back-yard composting plus citizen action to support county and 
city composting are part of the solution to the crisis surrounding the 
city-dump-is-going-to-overflow issue. 
</P>
<P>
What? Who cares? First, it's a citizen's concern and second, a homeowner's. As 
a citizen, you should know that if your city or county composts your yard and 
tree trimmings, it can obviate the need for more landfill sites and higher 
civic expenditures for refuse waste disposal. Consider: About half of what we 
throw away in California (i.e. every other full trash can) is compostable. It 
costs $65 to dump a ton of waste and $35 a ton to process it as compost. 
</P>
<P>
In a few weeks, the Ventura Regional Sanitation District will launch a pilot 
composting project in which Fillmore and Santa Paula, as well as selected fruit 
and vegetable processors, will bring 30 tons per week of compost waste to the 
Toland Road landfill during an experimental period of nine months. This means a 
pile of grass and tree trimmings big enough to cover Government Center won't 
become garbage. According to project coordinator Mark Capron, this volume is 
small compared to what they'd like to take out of the waste stream and what 
they need in the way of product. 
</P>
<P>
"With our county mulch needs and gardeners picking up free loads, we'd be 
running out of product even if we composted all the green waste in the county." 
</P>
<P>
In this respect Ventura is really fortunate to have desert soil, which cries 
out for compost. According to the Washington, D.C.-based Solid Wastes 
Management Assn., 13 Eastern states have such a surplus of green waste that 
they've mandated that cities stop putting it in landfills. Capron's colleague 
Kelly Polk says that's not indicated here. 
</P>
<P>
To save water and build a recycling ethic, county officials are encouraging 
back-yard composters. I put my plastic bin in the front yard for the same 
reason my parents put up a new antenna when we first got a color TV. It's going 
to be the latest thing. As with any gizmo, there's the $19 version and the $149 
version. 
</P>
<P>
But it's the mix you put into it that counts. 
</P>
<P>
The county mixes ingredients on an industrial scale, turning the layers of 
grass, leaves, tree shreddings and vegetable peelings with a Rototiller. 
Back-yard composters do it with a spade or composting tool. In the past, folks 
have simply piled and turned the ingredients every few months. Modern organic 
compounds enable us to achieve the same results in weeks in a special 
container. Local housewares stores are just now getting in yard waste recycling 
kits or will order them. 
</P>
<P>
Your own composting operation probably won't consume all your yard waste. It's 
also not a destination for meat, fat scraps or doggie doo. We're talking strict 
vegetarianism here from beginning to end. The result is rich, sweet-smelling 
humus. Giving yard wastes to the refuse hauler is like throwing out expensive 
bags of fertilizer and peat moss. If you had a regular free supply, you'd be 
delighted. Well you do, if you compost.
