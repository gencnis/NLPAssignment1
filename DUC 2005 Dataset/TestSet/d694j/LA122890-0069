CARSON ARRANGES COLLECTION, RECYCLING OF CHRISTMAS TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second consecutive year, the city of Carson has teamed with two private 
firms to recycle Christmas trees. 
</P>
<P>
Residents are being asked to place their trees -- minus ornaments, nails and 
stands -- curbside on their regular trash pickup day Wednesday, Thursday or 
Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Western Waste Industries, the city refuse hauler, will pick up the trees and 
take them to Kellogg Supply, a Carson-based fertilizing company. The firm will 
grind up the trees to make compost. City officials said last January's pickup 
collected about 8,000 trees that produced 55 tons of compost chips. 
</P>
<P>
Flocked trees cannot be recycled but will be picked up with other garbage.
