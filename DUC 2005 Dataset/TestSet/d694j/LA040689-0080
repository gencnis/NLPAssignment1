"In this world," Benjamin Franklin once said, "nothing is certain but death and 
taxes." 
</P>
<P>
And garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Face it, human beings are trash machines -- incapable of consuming anything 
without creating a pile of garbage seemingly twice the volume of the product. 
The United States now produces more than 400,000 tons of trash a day and space 
is running out -- landfills are overflowing, waterways are clogged and beaches 
are becoming lethal playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the total solid waste in this country added up to 160 million tons -- 
a full 8% of which came directly from the kitchen as food waste. There are 
16,400 landfills nationally, half of which are expected to close by the year 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
The one landfill that serves the District of Columbia and suburban Virginia is 
expected to be completely filled in the year 2003. The landfill for Montgomery 
County, Md., will be filled in this May. (A new application has been submitted 
to extend capacity until 2004.) 
</P>
<P>
How can you help break the wave of trash? 
</P>
<P>
According to Eric A. Goldstein, senior attorney at Natural Resources Defense 
Council in New York, three steps can be taken to substantially alleviate 
food-generated garbage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Make Compost 
</P>
<P>
First, he says, "to take a nice hunk out of the problem, people should set up 
composting programs in their back yards." Composting, the degradation process 
brought about by bacteria and fungus organisms, can effectively turn organic 
kitchen and garden refuse into a moist black soil conditioner. And, even 
apartment dwellers with balconies can compost, according to Pegi 
Ballister-Howells of the Rutgers Cooperative Extension for Middlesex County, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
To start composting, the Virginia Cooperative Extension Service suggests laying 
small twigs or chopped corn stalks down first to aid in aeration and drainage. 
Then, add both garden (yard waste accounts for a full 18% of landfill mass) and 
kitchen refuse such as husks, coffee grounds, crushed egg shells and canning 
wastes. Next, add a layer of a nitrogen-rich material such as fresh manure or 
fresh grass clippings, hay or green weeds (you can buy synthetic nitrogen 
fertilizer in the form of blood meal or cottonseed meal). Do not add meat -- it 
will attract rodents. Water the pile to keep the contents moist. If you smell a 
strong whiff of ammonia, the pile is either too tightly packed or too wet. Turn 
the heap, add some coarser material for aeration and start over. Every three or 
four weeks, fork over the pile, pushing outside material to the inside so that 
everything breaks down. 
</P>
<P>
As for the apartment method, here's how: Take a black (color is important 
because it absorbs heat) plastic bag, fill it three-quarters full with cooking 
and plant refuse (again only vegetable refuse; meat products could attract 
rodents), add a nitrogen product and fill with water (it will not decompose if 
dry). Set out on the balcony -- it needs the sunlight -- and poke holes in the 
bag to let the water drain out. "Every once in a while," suggests 
Ballister-Howells, "when you walk past, you can give the bag a kick, it moves 
things around and aerates it." If the bag loses its oxygen, she says, anaerobic 
bacteria will flourish and things will begin to get smelly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shopping Waste 
</P>
<P>
A second trash-reducing idea, according to Goldstein, is to be sensitive to 
waste in your shopping decisions. According to a report by Worldwatch 
Institute, an independent non-profit research organization, packaging accounts 
for about 30% of the weight and 50% of the volume of household waste. 
</P>
<P>
"The packaging explosion has gone too far," says Goldstein. "We don't need to 
wrap something in one layer, then rewrap in a bigger layer, and then put it in 
a plastic bag -- this is an area where consumers can make a big difference." 
The amount of packaging for food doubled, even tripled, after World War II, 
says Goldstein. In 1958, the per-capita consumption of packaging material in 
New York State was 404 pounds per year. By 1986, it had risen to 800 pounds. 
"Advertisers and marketing experts have assumed, and in some cases it's true, 
that packaging sells." So make sure, he says, that you're buying for the 
product, not the package. 
</P>
<P>
One obvious answer, says Goldstein, is bulk-food shopping. It not only benefits 
the consumer in price reduction and the environment in waste reduction, he 
says, it also benefits the producers themselves in overhead reduction -- they 
spend less on packaging, they lose less in the profit corner. "When I'm in the 
market," says Goldstein, the bulk-food aisle is "the most heavily populated 
aisle -- as the 1990s approach that will be an important trend emerging." 
</P>
<P>
According to a May 1987 article in Supermarket Business News, bulk food is, in 
fact, declining, as many supermarkets cut back on the number of items available 
or cut out the program completely. Safeway, which started its bulk-food program 
in 1983, sees no great increase or decrease in the number of people who shop 
from the bins. It has what Ann Cockrell of Safeway calls a stabilized customer 
base. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Take Your Own Bag 
</P>
<P>
A third contribution: Bring a satchel. Follow European shopping fashion and 
take your own bag to the store. "It's stupid when you go to get something that 
is already packaged to dump it into another plastic bag. Then when you get home 
you unpack bags, and they're all strewn all over the kitchen, you realize that 
the products you bought make up just under half of the total volume." 
</P>
<P>
Other shopping decisions might include insisting on recyclable cardboard 
(rather than Styrofoam) egg cartons, reaching for milk in the paper (rather 
than plastic) cartons and asking for paper bags when checking out. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Safeway and Giant offer the choice of paper or plastic. At Safeway 
in the second quarter of 1988, customers chose plastic over paper 3 to 1. In an 
effort to do its bit for the environment, Safeway is testing at its Vancouver 
stores a photodegradable plastic bag that breaks down into fragments when 
exposed to light and eventually reduces to carbon monoxide and water. 
</P>
<P>
Giant places its plastic-paper bag ratio at 60%-40% in favor of plastic. It has 
not yet incorporated a photodegradable bag in its stores, preferring for the 
moment to research bags that can decompose without sunlight -- something Mark 
Roeder of Giant says will be more useful in an area served mostly by landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling should come back full force, says Goldstein, to help combat the trash 
problem. And according to a national poll of 1,000 adults taken by Penn &amp; 
Schoen Associates, 91% said they would be willing to pay a few cents more for 
products packaged in recyclable or biodegradable material. 
</P>
<P>
"In World War II, we had a lot more recycling because of the need to preserve 
precious metals for the war." Then as materials returned to abundance, we 
became extravagant, Goldstein noted. "The legacy of the postwar era, while 
being a very productive era for us, is that we became a throw-away society." 
</P>
<P>
Olga Sweeney of US Recycling Centers Inc. in Rockville and Hagerstown, Md., 
says many residents have gotten the message. When she opened the center in 1986 
in Rockville, 40 people showing up on Saturdays was considered good. In the 
last few months, the number of people has quadrupled. "Recycling is very 
suddenly big business. And I think it's because that garbage barge from New 
York scared a lot of people," she said. (Call your local Extension service or 
look in your local Yellow Pages for nearby recycling centers.) 
</P>
<P>
Items to separate from your garbage and recycle include glass bottles and jars, 
aluminum beverage cans, foil, aluminum pie plates from frozen foods, cardboard, 
brown paper bags and newspaper. Recycling of paper is especially important as 
it is the largest single component in landfill waste -- taking up 36%. 
</P>
<P>
A word about plastic. 
</P>
<P>
It makes up 7% of the municipal solid waste. And only 1% of it currently being 
recycled. The most widely recycled plastic product is the soft-drink container 
-- 20% of which is being recycled. In an attempt to reduce plastic waste in New 
York, Gov. Mario Cuomo declared in March that his administration would begin 
phasing out the use of Styrofoam cups and other unbiodegradable plastic food 
containers at several of the state parks and beaches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Packaging Helps, Too 
</P>
<P>
Of course, food packaging is not all bad. Much of it has allowed us longer 
storage time on certain foods. Says Lenus Barnes, chief of the Solid Waste 
Regulation and Collection Section of Montgomery County, Md.: "I remember when 
there wasn't a lot of packaging, when my mother would have to throw out things 
that nowadays we could have stored a longer period of time and have consumed." 
</P>
<P>
But gone are the days of the American Indian who used every last scrap of the 
buffalo he killed. 
</P>
<P>
Says Goldstein: "Now garbage is excessive and a very expensive proposition. 
Disposal fees have in some cases doubled because we are running out of landfill 
space. Incinerators have their own environmental problems and are very 
expensive -- in fact, sometimes the single most expensive decision a community 
will have to make." 
</P>
<P>
What makes economic and environmental sense in the end, concludes Goldstein, is 
recycling and waste reduction through responsible buying.
