Two Orange County businessmen convicted of causing the collapse of Ramona 
Savings &amp; Loan in Santa Ana received severe prison sentences Tuesday in 
federal court in Los Angeles and were ordered to pay millions of dollars in 
restitution to the government. 
</P>
<P>
Donald P. Mangano Sr., 53, of Huntington Beach, was sentenced to 15 years in 
prison, and John L. Molinaro, 49, of San Jose, received a 12-year sentence on 
charges of fraud and conspiracy that led to the thrift's 1986 collapse. They 
were also ordered to pay $6.8 million in restitution to the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The two men were convicted in October on more than 30 counts of bank fraud and 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an element in this whole thing of cynicism and ruthlessness and 
deceit," said U.S. District Court Judge David V. Kenyon in announcing the 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Neither man showed any reaction as Kenyon read the sentences. Molinaro, dressed 
in a wrinkled blue work shirt and prison fatigues, leaned back in his chair. 
Mangano looked down at a note pad. The men will be eligible for parole in four 
to five years. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said it was pleased with Kenyon's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We regard this as a significant victory for the government in its efforts to 
punish those responsible for the savings and loan crisis," said Asst. U.S. 
Attorney Steven E. Zipperstein. "The sentence will send a message to other 
savings and loan owners that white-collar crime doesn't pay." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys expressed little surprise at the length of the sentences, 
claiming that Kenyon was under pressure from regulators to set an example. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon had received letters from the nation's top banking regulators, including 
FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman, appealing for long prison terms for both men. 
</P>
<P>
The Ramona case has attracted a great deal of attention because Molinaro and 
Mangano were the first owners of a failed thrift in Southern California to face 
criminal charges since the nation's thrift debacle began to unfold in the late 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The 2 1/2-hour sentencing proceeding became rather delicate when the subject 
became Mangano's deteriorating health. He is a quadriplegic -- the victim of a 
bout with polio more than 30 years ago -- and his attorneys have claimed that 
any kind of incarceration could result in his death. 
</P>
<P>
Mangano's attorneys pleaded with Kenyon on Tuesday to place him on probation.
