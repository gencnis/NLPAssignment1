The former president of a Woodland Hills real estate investment company that 
defrauded more than 200 investors out of an estimated $12 million was sentenced 
Thursday in federal court to six years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
In sentencing Alan R. Keranen, 42, to federal prison, U.S. District Judge 
William Matthew Byrne rejected an unusual request from Keranen that he receive 
a 10-year sentence during which he would be jailed one week of every month and 
be free the rest of the time to work to pay back the investors. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne rejected the proposal, saying the fraud was too serious not to merit a 
standard prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Anita H. Dymant also opposed Keranen's proposal and had 
asked Byrne to sentence the once-flamboyant salesman to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
In sentencing Keranen to six years, Byrne also ordered him to make restitution 
of $3.5 million to investors. 
</P>
<P>
Keranen, who used to live in Woodland Hills but now resides in Oregon, was 
charged in June with taking nearly $4 million in cash and real estate from 
California Anchor Group after fraudulently enticing investors with claims of 
25% yearly returns on their investments. 
</P>
<P>
The company was supposed to build and sell San Fernando Valley apartment 
complexes, but prosecutors said only about 3% of the investors' money went into 
such developments. 
</P>
<P>
Keranen later pleaded guilty to two counts of bank fraud and two counts of mail 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"I committed the crimes," Keranen said tearfully during his sentencing hearing. 
"I did wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Dumas and Ronald Stoliar, California Anchor vice presidents, pleaded 
guilty to lesser charges. 
</P>
<P>
Stoliar was placed on five years probation by Byrne. 
</P>
<P>
Dumas, who was scheduled to be sentenced Thursday, did not appear and a warrant 
has been issued for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Keranen has filed for bankruptcy and his attorney said he had about $100,000 
available for restitution. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of California Anchor investors watched the sentencing and left with 
little hope of ever getting much of their money back. 
</P>
<P>
"The chances are about as good as getting a glass of ice water in hell," said 
Terry Thomason, a Canoga Park investor who said his family lost $250,000 in the 
scam.
