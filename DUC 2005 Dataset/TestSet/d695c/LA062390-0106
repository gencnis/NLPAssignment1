Lisa A. Jones, a teen-age runaway who became a $100,000-a-year trading 
assistant at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., got a reduction Friday in the 
sentence she received for lying to a grand jury investigating Wall Street 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand reduced his original 18-month prison 
sentence to 10 months after an appeals court threw out the longer term on 
grounds that it was stiffer than mandated by federal sentencing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Sand also fined Jones $25,000 and ordered her to pay $14,850 for the cost of 
her incarceration. In addition, he required her to receive mental health 
treatment during her term. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the original sentence violated 
guidelines that govern crimes occurring after January, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 27, was convicted in March, 1989, of seven counts of perjury and 
obstruction of justice for lying in January, 1988, to a federal grand jury 
investigating trading activities at Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Sand said he was sympathetic to Jones' psychological problems and troubled 
childhood -- she ran away from home at 14 -- but said deterrence was necessary 
because she lied repeatedly to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' behavior was "not a sudden impulse," the judge said. "It was a 
persistent conduct of perjury on several occasions, despite warnings" from the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who worked at Drexel's Beverly Hills junk- bond department, was the 
first person convicted in the government's lengthy investigation of fraud on 
Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
She was an assistant to Drexel trader Bruce L. Newberg, who was convicted in 
the Princeton-Newport case and sentenced to three months in prison. She was not 
charged with violating securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
Jones sobbed throughout the sentencing and afterward was hugged by three 
friends, including Newberg's wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing takes away this agony for very long," she said in a letter to the 
judge. "I live each day in the totality of my crisis. There are never-ending 
sleepless nights and days full of anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been shattered and humiliated," she wrote. "I don't even know where to 
begin to try to rebuild my life." 
</P>
<P>
Jones is to surrender to federal authorities by July 23 to begin her sentence. 
</P>
<P>
She must spend five months at a minimum-security prison camp in Phoenix before 
becoming eligible for transfer to a halfway house in Los Angeles or to home 
detention.
