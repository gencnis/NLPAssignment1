</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego man was sentenced to 15 months in prison Monday for helping his 
bosses swindle $6 million from investors who bought old coins from an Orange 
County business. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Thompson, 28, formerly of Orange, had pleaded guilty to one count of wire 
fraud stemming from his activities as sales administrator of the now-defunct 
Marco Numismatics, which operated in Costa Mesa from 1985 to 1988, said 
Assistant U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the prison term, U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts, sitting in Santa 
Ana, ordered Thompson to pay $7,000 restitution, Umberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The sentencing ends a case that saw seven men found guilty of federal crimes 
linked to the scam. Some were convicted at trial; others pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
The father-son team that ran the business, Vincent L. Caterino, 59, of 
Riverside and James N. Caterino, 29, of Costa Mesa, were sentenced to prison 
this month for masterminding the high-pressure phone sales operation. They were 
convicted of conspiracy, mail fraud and wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Salesmen persuaded investors to buy rare or old coins that were vastly 
overvalued.
