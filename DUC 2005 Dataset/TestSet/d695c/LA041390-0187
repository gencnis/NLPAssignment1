<P>
A specialist firm on the New York Stock Exchange was fined $480,350 for 
securities fraud by a judge who said he imposed the sentence as a deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
"The trading while in possession of confidential material is a crime." U.S. 
District Judge Charles S. Haight said Thursday at the sentencing of Marcus 
Schloss &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
"It constitutes an affront to the fair operation of the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Marcus Schloss was the first NYSE firm to be convicted of 
felony charges related to insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
The company was convicted last July of conspiracy to trade on inside 
information and of securities fraud in connection with its March 1986 purchase 
of stock in American Brands Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Schloss could have been fined a maximum of $1 million -- $500,000 for 
each of two counts. 
</P>
<P>
Haight, however, said he considered only a fine of $500,000 because both 
charges stemmed from the American Brands deal. 
</P>
<P>
From that amount, the judge said he subtracted $19,650 which the company 
previously paid the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle civil charges 
stemming from the American Brands trade.
