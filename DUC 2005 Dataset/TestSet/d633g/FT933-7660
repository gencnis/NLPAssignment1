THE GOVERNMENT's plans for reorganising local government in Wales and
Scotland should be withdrawn, leaders of the Assembly of Welsh Counties and
Convention of Scottish Local Authorities said yesterday.
In a joint declaration after a meeting in Cardiff they described the
proposals as 'a serious threat to local democracy, to the delivery of
services and to the social and economic well-being of communities'.
They called on the government to set up independent commissions to recommend
the structure and organisation of local government that would best deliver
services.
The government has published white papers for local government reform in
Wales and Scotland. In Wales the existing eight county and 37 district
councils would be replaced by 21 unitary authorities.
Scotland's three island, nine regional and 53 district councils would be
replaced by 28 single-tier councils.
The Welsh and Scottish associations said: 'The process of transition is
certain to be costly and hinder the development of policies on community
care, on protection of the environment and on the encouragement of
investment.'
The associations said they would not co-operate with the government over its
proposals, and reorganisation should not be considered until it had agreed
to create a directly elected Welsh assembly and Scottish parliament.
In contrast to the Assembly of Welsh Counties, the Council of Welsh
Districts wants the government to press ahead with the reforms.
