PLAID CYMRU, the Welsh nationalist party, was last night poised to hold its
three seats in its north-west stronghold but to add no others.
The party would not enter into political deals in the event of a hung
parliament, said Mr Dafydd Wigley, its president.
He said: 'There is no question of Plaid Cymru entering into a coalition. Our
MPs would keep their hands free to consider every issue in the House of
Commons.
'We will consider the proposals in the first Queen's Speech in the light of
the policies in our manifesto.'
The party's policies are closest to those of Labour. The Welsh nationalists
would probably be willing to provide ad hoc support to a Labour minority
government, but without the sort of unconditional guarantees required for
stable rule.
Labour has promised a Welsh assembly within the lifetime of a par-liament.
Plaid Cymru has said it would seek a guarantee that Wales would be treated
as favourably as Scotland on devolution. It also wants any Welsh parliament,
which it says should be set up within a year, to have revenue-raising
powers.
Other commitments required might include a comprehensive language act and a
low-interest loan fund for farmers.
