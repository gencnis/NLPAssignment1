ASTRA, the Swedish drugs group, said it has not withdrawn its schizophrenia
treatment from sale in Europe, despite a decision by its partner Merck to
warn against its use in the US.
More than 100 people in the US who took part in clinical trials on the drug,
known as Roxiam, had been continuing to take it pending a decision on its
authorisation by the US's Food and Drug Admistration, Merck said.
Prompted by blood disorders in eight patients taking the drug in Europe,
including one death, Merck earlier this week said it had advised doctors in
the US to stop medication.
Astra, which developed the product and has marketed it in Europe for
two-and-a-half years, said it had recommended 'far-reaching precautions' in
the use of the drug.
Full information on the product, which had sales in the first three months
of the year of SKr50m (Dollars 6m), had been sent to regulatory authorities
and physicians, it added.
