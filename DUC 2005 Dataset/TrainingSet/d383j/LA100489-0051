The federal government on Tuesday approved a new drug to treat severe 
schizophrenia and a monitoring program in which patients using the drug will be 
tested weekly for signs of a potentially fatal side effect. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration said the drug, clozapine, can be used only for 
patients who have not responded to at least two regimens of standard, less 
toxic therapy. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 200,000 people could benefit, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
The drug has been shown to relieve symptoms of severe schizophrenia, allowing 
patients to lead more productive lives. But it also can cause a potentially 
fatal blood disorder in which the level of white blood cells is reduced. 
Studies have shown the condition can be reversed if caught early. 
</P>
<P>
The drug also is associated with seizures, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the monitoring system, a home health care company will distribute the 
prescribed medication to patients each week and collect blood samples that will 
be sent to a national laboratory for analysis, the FDA said. If the test 
results indicate that the patient must stop taking the drug, the patient's 
doctor will be notified.
