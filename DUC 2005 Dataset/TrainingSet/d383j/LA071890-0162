Question: In a recent column, you described DES as a morning-after pill and 
said it was taken years ago by pregnant women. You didn't say why, leaving the 
impression that these women were trying to abort their pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
That's not true at all! Back in the 1950s we women were given DES to try to 
prevent miscarriages. I'd hate for my children -- or anyone else -- to think I 
was trying to end a pregnancy when I took DES. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You are quite right that DES (diethylstilbestrol) was prescribed from 
the 1940s through the 1960s in the hopes of preventing miscarriages. It wasn't 
prescribed as a morning-after contraceptive until the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Because you took DES during pregnancy, your daughter (if you had one) should be 
careful to get regular gynecological exams, as she may be at higher risk of 
certain cancers or ectopic pregnancy.

Q: Will SOD pills sold in health food stores help arthritis and relieve pain? 
</P>
<P>
A: Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is digested in the stomach and is unlikely to be 
absorbed or help arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
Q: For years I suffered deep depressions. It was a nightmare, and none of the 
many medications prescribed to me really helped. 
</P>
<P>
Since I was put on Prozac my life has turned around. I feel great. Just thought 
you should have some perspective to counteract some of the bad things you have 
said about this wonderful drug. 
</P>
<P>
A. There is no doubt that Prozac (fluoxetine) has helped many people. It 
relieves depression and does not produce some of the side effects most common 
to other antidepressant medications. 
</P>
<P>
As beneficial as Prozac may be, though, some people do experience adverse 
reactions. One reader wrote to say she had to stop taking this drug due to 
"anxiety, headache, decreased appetite and concentration, weight loss, and 
terrible insomnia."
