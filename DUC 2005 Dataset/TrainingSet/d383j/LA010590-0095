The Food and Drug Administration has given final approval to a drug to treat 
obsessive-compulsive disorder, a mental illness thought to afflict at least one 
in 40 Americans, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
FDA spokeswoman Eva Kemper said that the agency gave CIBA-Geigy Corp. of 
Summit, N. J., permission late last week to market clomipramine for use by 
people whose lives are seriously disrupted by obsessive-compulsive disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Kemper said that she did not know how many of the estimated 5 million Americans 
with the mental disorder -- marked by compulsive, repetitive acts like hand 
washing or floor scrubbing -- might benefit from the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Clomipramine, sold under the trade name Anafranil, has been available on a 
special case-by-case basis to U.S. patients since June, 1988. It is used in 
Europe to treat some patients with depression, Kemper said. 
</P>
<P>
The drug should be used in obsessive-compulsive disorder cases only when 
treatments like behavior modification have failed, Kemper said, noting that 
about 1.5% of the people who took the drug for a year suffered from seizures. 
Other side effects include dry mouth, drowsiness, constipation, increased 
appetite and impotence, she said. 
</P>
<P>
David Catlett, a spokesman for CIBA-Geigy, said he could not disclose how much 
clomipramine would cost or when it would be widely available. The company plans 
to hold a news conference Tuesday in New York to release marketing details. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Jenike, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical 
School, said that about 80% to 90% of the obsessive-compulsive patients he has 
seen require medication such as clomipramine. 
</P>
<P>
Jenike estimates that about 85% of people experience "some benefit" from the 
drug, a success rate he termed "quite remarkable." About 50% of the patients 
report their symptoms are much better after taking the drug, he said.
