Toshiba, the Japanese electronics company, has been barred by the Japanese
government from exporting semiconductors to 27 present and former communist
nations for one month after admitting that it violated the regulations of
the Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls.
The case arose after documents from the former East Germany were uncovered
by the Japanese media, forcing the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry to investigate Toshiba's alleged exports of leading-edge
semiconductor equipment from December 1986 to February 1987.
Miti officials said Toshiba exported masks and 150 silicon wafers to East
Germany, as well as providing documents detailing the production of advanced
memory chips. The case is embarrassing for the Japanese government, which
claimed that it maintained tight controls over exports of strategic
technologies.
However, Miti's punishment is relatively lenient, as the 27 countries
include Mongolia, Vietnam and North Korea, none of which is a leading
importer of Japanese semiconductor products. China is the only significant
market temporarily closed to Toshiba.
Miti officials also reprimanded Mitsui, the trading house, which was
involved in collecting payments for the deal. As is customary in such cases,
Mitsui said its employees had acted without authorisation, and that two
officials had been reprimanded.
The Japanese government has imposed penalties in 10 cases of Cocom
violations, and Miti said the export ban imposed on Toshiba was thought
appropriate because the statute of limitations had expired for a criminal
action against the company. Toshiba estimates that its semiconductor exports
to the 27 countries in an average month total Y1.6bn (Pounds 10m). Total
exports of chips this year will be around Y280bn.
