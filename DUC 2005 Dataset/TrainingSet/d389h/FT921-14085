Three former top managers of Germany's largest steel company, Thyssen, have
been charged with illegally exporting rocket engine pumps to Iraq, Reuter
reports from Bochum.
. The prosecutor's office said the three were suspected of exporting 35
turbo pumps and five jet casings, valued at DM1.9m (Pounds 660,000), to Iraq
in the spring of 1990, without obtaining proper export permits.
