A Korean-American businessman was arrested in Newark, N. J., on charges of 
trying to illegally buy and export deadly quarter-ton nerve-gas bombs and an 
array of other weapons, some of which may have been meant for sale to Iran. 
Juwhan Yun, the 48-year-old president of Komex International Corp. in Short 
Hills, N. J., was accused of having negotiated with an undercover U.S. Customs 
Service agent to ship bombs containing a lethal gas known as Sarin. Officials 
described Sarin as a colorless, odorless poison that quickly attacks the 
nervous system after being inhaled, absorbed through the skin or swallowed. 
They added that it has not been manufactured in this country since 1970 and 
cannot be exported legally.
