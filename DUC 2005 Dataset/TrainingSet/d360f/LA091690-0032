DARYL GATES' COMMENTS ON DRUG USERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Studies have repeatedly shown that the consumption and production of marijuana 
in the United States is on the decrease, and that criminalization costs society 
more in terms of increased law-enforcement-related costs and deprived revenues 
from taxes on pot than legalization would. 
</P>
<P>
The dangers of marijuana are fewer than such legal substances as tobacco and 
alcohol, and any crime and violence connected to it is a direct result of its 
criminalization. 
</P>
<P>
If it were not for demagogic political grandstanding of the "war on drugs" ilk, 
it would have been legal long ago. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, our country's real drug problems grow unabated. Our current problems 
of drug-related crime, violence, deaths, disease and birth defects are 
primarily fueled by cocaine and crack, and to a lesser extent (as the number of 
addicts to those substances are lower than cocaine and crack) heroin and 
methamphetamine.
