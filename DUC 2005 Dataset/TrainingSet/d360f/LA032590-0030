CONTROVERSY OVER LEGALIZATION OF DRUGS IN AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Film at 11, but Not Much Protection," by former New York City 
Police Commissioner, Patrick Murphy, March 13: 
</P>
<P>
He advocates additional police officers "on the beat" and greater cooperation 
by the public at the neighborhood level. Amen to that. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy does not make a distinction between legalization and decriminalization 
of drugs, but there is a big difference -- to "legalize" would put government 
in the position of condoning drug use. To "decriminalize" has government 
saying, in essence, that it's none of government's business if one wants to 
diminish his well-being with drug use. 
</P>
<P>
If drugs were freely available in a free market there would not be big profits 
and no need for a black market. Who would push drugs if there was little profit 
to be had? 
</P>
<P>
But admittedly, the decriminalization of drugs is a short-term solution. The 
long-term solution depends upon education -- that people will know the evils of 
drug use and say "no."
