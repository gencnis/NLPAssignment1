legalise cannabis

The Liberal Democrat conference last night caused deep embarrassment to the
party leadership by calling for the use and possession of cannabis to be
decriminalised.
Members of the student wing of the party yelled delighted approval when it
was announced that their three-year campaign to get the issue debated had
ended in triumph. Decriminalisation was approved by a majority of 51 after
Mr Paddy Ashdown and other leading figures in the party had voted against.
But Mr Ashdown insisted that the party's next election manifesto would
include no commitment to the decriminalisation of cannabis.
Delegates also called for a royal commission to investigate and consider
strategies for combating drug misuse.
This was emphasised by the leadership in its frantic attempts to limit the
damage it fears the vote is likely to cause. It insisted that a royal
commission would reject decriminalisation of cannabis and other soft drugs.
Mr Ashdown said: 'The conference voted today for a royal commission on drugs
 -no more and no less.
'A royal commission is the proper and only place for serious consideration
of a number of issues relating to drugs, including the decriminalisation of
cannabis.'
Mr Simon Hughes, MP for Southwark and Bermondsey, had pleaded in vain to the
conference 'to be responsible and vote against the soft option'. He said a
vote for decriminalisation would 'do ourselves and the country a
disservice'.
Mr Alan Beith, deputy leader, said decriminalisation would not stop dealers.
He feared that organised crime would move into an opened-up cannabis market,
or exploit the increased demand for other drugs likely to result from such a
change.
