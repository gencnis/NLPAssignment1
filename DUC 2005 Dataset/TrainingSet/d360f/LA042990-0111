ANTI-ABUSE VACCINE IS THE WRONG APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As are former Secretary of State George Schultz, William F. Buckley, New York 
Times columnist Tom Wicker, Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Freidman and 
many others, I am for legalizing drugs. And taking the profit out of drug sales 
is the only way to begin the control of such sales. 
</P>
<P>
However, the most compelling argument for legalization is not the economic 
argument. It happens to be the answer to Michael Schrage's second question: 
"Why government oversight of cocaine sales is morally superior to insisting 
that children get inoculated." 
</P>
<P>
The logical answer is obvious to any clear-thinking freedom-lover: To insist 
that children get inoculated is a forced intrusion on the bodies of our 
citizens whereas government oversight of cocaine sales simply allows each 
individual the freedom to choose, the very basis for free Western democracies.
