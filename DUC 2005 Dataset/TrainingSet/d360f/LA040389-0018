TARGETING YUPPIE DRUG USERS

Regarding the "war on drugs" and Bennett's strategy for it: let's get one thing 
straight. The violence associated with the drug trade is not the fault of drug 
users, be they yuppie or otherwise. Rather, it is a direct result of the laws 
against drug use. This is a simple case of cause and effect. Originally, drugs 
were legal, and there was no drug-related violence. Then laws were passed 
against drug use, and a black market formed, dominated by organized crime and 
gangs, who use violent means to sustain their domination. If drugs were 
legalized again, the black market would disappear. Drug abuse is selfish and 
stupid, but is not the cause of drug-related violence.

Rather, the violence is the fault of those like Bennett who have made drug use 
a moral issue, thus negating any possibility of drug legalization. Drug abuse 
is no more a moral issue than alcohol abuse; and alcohol is a legal drug (of 
which Bennnett reputedly consumed at least his share during his college days.) 
Drug abuse is a social issue, and it doesn't warrant the hysteria that is 
gripping this country. There are much more serious issues.

For instance, there is a product in America, the abuse of which kills more 
people every year than Americans were killed in the entire Vietnam War. In 
addition, it causes millions of injuries, costs the nation hundreds of millions 
of dollars in social services, is a prime contributor to the greenhouse effect, 
and is a source of daily stress to most of the adult population. The product 
is, of course, the automobile. Cars are legal, and even considered beneficial 
to society. Which they are, but the car problem in America is far worse than 
the drug problem. So, until President Bush appoints a "car czar," why doesn't 
he give Bennett a real job -- like working on alleviating the problems that 
cause people to turn to drugs in the first place.
