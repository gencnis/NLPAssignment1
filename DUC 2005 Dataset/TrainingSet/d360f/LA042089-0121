Ralph Lee White, a former Stockton councilman who was thrown out of office for 
bribing a voter, announced his candidacy for state controller on a platform of 
legalizing drugs."We should legalize drugs because it would stop the killing 
between gangs," White said at a Stockton news conference announcing his 
candidacy for the Democratic nomination, if incumbent Gray Davis runs for 
governor as expected. White's colorful and controversial career on the City 
Council ended in 1987, when the state Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling 
disqualifying him from the seat he won in a 1984 special election.
