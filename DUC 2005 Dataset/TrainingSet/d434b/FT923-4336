THE Russian central bank has moved to tackle arrears accumulated by Russian
state-owned enterprises in dealings with those in other former Soviet
republics but denied this signalled a further expansion of central bank
credits.
It said a 'netting out' of debts would be completed by the end of November.
But it was not clear how the net arrears still outstanding after that to
Russian enterprises by republics in the rest of the Commonwealth of
Independent States and Georgia would be financed.
The Russian central bank plans to issue guarantees for Russian enterprises
to receive credit to get over the non-payments by other republics.
All republics can issue central bank credits and all of them are short of
budget revenues.
In another deal stressing creativity in relations with republics, Russia
said it would give Lithuania two torpedo boats and two small anti-submarine
vessels for undertaking to build flats for some of the army officers who are
to due be pulled out of the Baltic republics.
Moscow, which also undertook to supply Lithuania with oil this year and the
next, yesterday signed a trade pact with Estonia to guarantee free trade and
energy supplies. The agreement has been reached despite Moscow's continuing
unhappiness with the treatment of Russians in Estonia as second-class
citizens.
