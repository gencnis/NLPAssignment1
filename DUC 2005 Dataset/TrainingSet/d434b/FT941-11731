Finnish exports to Russia, which crashed following the collapse of the
Soviet Union, doubled last year as a surge in transit trade helped what
officials in Helsinki hope will be the gradual rehabilitation of a trade
relationship that was previously a mainstay of Finland's economy, Hugh
Carnegy reports from Helsinki .
Figures published showed a 100 per cent increase in exports to Russia to
FM6.04bn (Pounds 700m) in 1993. Exports to Estonia were also up almost 110
per cent to FM1.9bn, helping to push up the share of Finnish exports bought
by former Soviet territories to 6.2 per cent of the total, compared to a low
of 4.3 per cent in 1992.
