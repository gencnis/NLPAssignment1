THE International Monetary Fund has delivered a grim prognosis for the
economies of the three Baltic republics.
In separate studies of the three newly independent countries, the IMF
describes the economic outlook for Latvia and Lithuania this year as
'bleak', while it calls Estonia's economic situation 'precarious'.
Latvia faces a drop in real gross domestic product of as much as 30 per cent
this year after an 8 per cent decline in 1991. Some enterprises are being
forced to halt activity because of shortages of energy and other raw
materials.
In Lithuania, many enterprises will face the same fuel shortages unless the
disruption to trade with other republics of the former Soviet Union is
overcome.
Even if it succeeds in this, the IMF expects Lithuania's output to decline
by at least 15 per cent and possibly by more than 30 per cent, on top of the
20 per cent decline recorded in 1990-91.
Estonia's 'already precarious economic situation' has been exacerbated, the
IMF says, by the dislocation of its trade with other former Soviet republics
and the shock caused by the higher cost of imports at world market prices.
'The prospect for 1992 is for a further fall in real GDP, perhaps of the
order of 20 per cent, even if trade relations with other republics can be
normalised,' the Fund's study warns. Inflation has raged in all three
republics, topping 200 per cent last year in Lithuania and Estonia and
exceeding 300 per cent in Latvia.
The republics plan to introduce their own currencies, but this may be
delayed until later this year. While they continue to use the rouble, their
inflation performance will be tied to Russia's.
For Estonia, inflation may exceed 400 per cent this year, the IMF says, but
in Lithuania the introduction of its new currency, the litas, 'will provide
an opportunity to achieve a sharp reduction in the wage-price spiral'.
