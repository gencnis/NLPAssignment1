Despite appeals by environmentalists, China is pressing ahead with its 
"rent-a-panda" diplomacy by sending the endangered animals to zoos around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Two giant pandas will be flown to Singapore in October and placed on display 
for three months. 
</P>
<P>
China Wildlife Conservation Assn. official Song Huigang defended the policy and 
angrily denounced attempts by the World Wide Fund for Nature to stop the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 1,000 pandas are believed to survive in China, according to a recent 
estimate by a leading Chinese zoologist who said the population is being 
ravaged by illegal hunting and a deteriorating environment. 
</P>
<P>
To protect the bearlike creatures from extinction China stopped giving pandas 
to other countries in 1985, after donating more than 20 to foreign zoos. 
</P>
<P>
But the "rent-a-panda" business has never ceased and earns valuable hard 
currency for China. 
</P>
<P>
A 100-day loan of an animal costs more than $400,000, foreign sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question of a price," said a second official of the Chinese 
conservation association. "But we welcome a donation." 
</P>
<P>
China said the money is spent protecting pandas. 
</P>
<P>
When Australia rented two pandas in 1988 after Prime Minister Bob Hawke cuddled 
one in a Chinese zoo, the "donation" amounted to several hundred thousand 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no such thing as a free panda," a Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The World Wide Fund for Nature, which has adopted the panda as its symbol, is 
opposed to flying pandas around the world because they are an endangered 
species. 
</P>
<P>
"They have no right to interfere in China's affairs," Song said. 
</P>
<P>
"They use our panda as their emblem and have raised $20 million," he said. "But 
only $2 million of the money is put to use in China's panda rescue efforts." 
</P>
<P>
China said large sums have been spent on saving the animals, which are found 
only in China, and smugglers and hunters caught trading in their have been 
executed.
