The 12 European Community states agreed in principle today to ban the import of 
ivory which threatens the African elephant with extinction, diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
Until a community ban on raw and worked ivory is completed, environment 
ministers may take emergency action against imports in their own countries. 
Britain, which initiated the EC action, has decided on an immediate ban, the 
diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
African elephants, slaughtered by poachers for their ivory tusks, have dwindled 
to 625,000 today from 1.3 million in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The EC's executive Commission will draw up proposals for a ban that could be 
adopted by the end of June. The EC also plans to back a call for a global ban 
at a meeting of 102 nations in Switzerland in October.
