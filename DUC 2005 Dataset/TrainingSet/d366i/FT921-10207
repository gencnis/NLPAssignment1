NEWMONT MINING, North America's biggest gold producer, has signed a protocol
of agreement to process ore stockpiled at Muruntau in newly-independent
Uzbekistan, reputed to be the world's biggest open pit gold mine.
Muruntau produces about 1.8m troy ounces of gold a year from reserves which
will last until about 2,040. However, it has stockpiled low-grade material
from which milling cannot extract enough gold.
Under the terms of the proposed joint venture with the Uzbekistan
government, Newmont will build huge plastic pads on which this low-grade ore
will be piled and the gold leached out with a cyanide-water mixture.
Heap-leach technology revolutionised gold mining in North America and
Australia in the past 20 years and Newmont claims to be the world's largest
user at its mines on the Carlin Trend in Nevada. They produced 1.58m ounces
of gold last year.
Analysts estimate it will cost between USDollars 70m and Dollars 75m for
crushing equipment and to build the leach pads and associated plant at
Muruntau, which is about 250 miles north west of Tashkent.
The contract, which Mr James Hill, Newmont's vice-president, corporate
relations, said could be signed as early as March, calls for Newmont to
process 150m tonnes of stockpiled material over the next 20 years. This
should extract between 180,000 and 360,000 ounces of gold a year, which
would be sold for the equal benefit of the government and Newmont.
Mr Hill hoped this would lead to more contracts between Newmont (which has
Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier as its biggest shareholder)
and Uzbekistan, the second-largest gold producer among the former Soviet
republics. He hoped the Muruntau arrangement would attract the interest and
support of western banks.
