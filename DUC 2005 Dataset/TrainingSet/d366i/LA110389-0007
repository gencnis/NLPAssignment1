METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 BROTHERS TO SERVE TIME FOR CYANIDE DUMPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two brothers who operated a North Hollywood plating company that dumped 
thousands of gallons of cyanide-laced waste water into the Los Angeles sewer 
system pleaded guilty Thursday and must serve jail time for recklessly handling 
and storing hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
Yoav (Joe) Pantilant, 52, of Woodland Hills, owner and president of 
All-American Plating Corp., was sentenced to nine months in jail, fined $10,000 
and ordered to clean up the site within six months by Municipal Judge David S. 
Milton as part of an agreement under which he pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
His brother, Sarv (Tom) Pantilant, 45, of Saugus, who was general manager of 
the firm, pleaded guilty to the same two charges and, also under the plea 
agreement, is scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 15 to six months in jail, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. William W. Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers originally faced one felony count and seven misdemeanor counts in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
They were the first in the county to be prosecuted under a 10-month-old state 
law that mandates jail time for improperly storing hazardous materials, Carter 
said. The new law also allows authorities to take action against a firm before 
a potentially hazardous chemical spill occurs, he said.
