'BAKA': CAPTIVATING LOOK AT ANOTHER CULTURE

Sometimes the best story is the one simply told. Case in point: "Baka: People 
of the Forest," an hourlong "National Geographic" special airing tonight at 8 
on Channels 28, 15 and 24, and at 9 on Channel 50. 
</P>
<P>
"Baka" is a straightforward look at the lives of a small group of pygmies in 
southeastern Cameroon and, in this case, straightforward does not mean dull: 
"Baka" is an understated, captivating study of another culture. 
</P>
<P>
Producer-writer Phil Agland and associate producers Lisa Silcock and Michael 
Harrison -- all of whom lived with the Baka for two years -- have produced a 
rare, poignant glimpse into the everyday life of a little-known tribe. 
</P>
<P>
Concentrating on the lives of one family -- Likano, his wife, Deni, and their 
sons, Yeye and Ali -- "Baka" fully engages the viewer while showing the story 
of this hunter-gatherer society through the family's words and actions. 
Following the family as they search for the peke fruit, a staple of their diet, 
prepare natural medicines, and get ready for Deni's coming child, "Baka's" 
recording of the similarities between modern culture and this "primitive" 
society are striking. 
</P>
<P>
The family is only a peripheral part of one riveting sequence, waiting on the 
ground while a determined villager climbs a 140-foot-tall tree -- a perilous 
barefoot ascent that takes several hours -- to raid a bee's nest of its honey. 
The climber stuns the bees with smoking leaves and a cyanide compound, just one 
example among many of the wondrous pharmacopeia of the Baka. 
</P>
<P>
"Baka" touches on the greatest problem facing the Baka -- the destruction of 
their homeland, the rain forest -- with a nice subtlety that other documentary 
makers could do well to study: The subtitles let the pygmies speak for 
themselves and the narration (by actor Denzel Washington) contains little 
strident preaching. 
</P>
<P>
Through its unadorned scenes of parents rearing children, friends talking and 
people working, "Baka" skillfully drives home its point: This endangered group 
of pygmies may seem exotic, but their humanity is universal. MARTIN ZIMMERMAN
