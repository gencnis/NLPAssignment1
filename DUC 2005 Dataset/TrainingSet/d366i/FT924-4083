threaten an environmental disaster

FOR 15 years the town of Mojkovac in Montenegro, part of the rump of
Yugoslavia, watched the dam covering what used to be its football pitch fill
up with millions of tons of poisonous mining waste.
'In the summer the water on top evaporated and gave off a mist that affected
people's breathing. We knew the dump was hazardous, but our requests for a
study were ignored for years,' says Mr Miso Stanisic, the mayor.
Mojkovac's problem now threatens to turn into an international environmental
disaster. Freak floods in October caused the Tara river to burst its banks,
washing away the base of the dam along a quarter of its 600-metre length.
Despite United Nations-assisted efforts to repair the dam over the past two
weeks, there is still serious risk that the damaged part may collapse,
releasing some of the 3.5m tons of toxic waste it contains into the Tara,
which flows into the Danube above Belgrade.
'Below a sandy crust, the sludge is extremely unstable and it is steadily
pushing forward against the weak part of the dam. It could give way at any
time,' said Mr Thomas Dolder, a civil engineer advising the UN disaster
relief organisation.
Even a relatively small discharge could kill fish and aquatic plants in the
Tara, a Unesco-protected waterway which the Montenegrans call 'the cleanest
river in Europe', and make the water undrinkable in the Drina, Sava and
Danube rivers all the way to the Black Sea.
Floods, the worst that anyone in Mojkovac can remember, could not have come
at a more difficult moment, given that Montenegro is included in the UN
embargo on trade with Yugoslavia and now has little contact with the rest of
Europe. It was several weeks before the republic's request for aid following
the floods reached the UN.
Although sanctions were lifted to permit the delivery of 1,600 steel cages
and other dam protection equipment, Montenegran officials blamed the embargo
for the slow pace of repairs.
Not enough bulldozers and excavators are at work on the site. While
floodlights are positioned around the dump, allowing for round-the-clock
activity, there are no light bulbs to be found.
According to UN divers, the dam be touched up in just two days if work
speeded up sufficiently.
However, fuel is only available on the black market at high prices and
Montenegro's new private contractors are not necessarily willing to accept
the low rate offered by the public works ministry, responsible for repairs.
Some of Mojkovac's 11,000 residents will even admit to wishing the dump
could be washed downstream and out of their lives. Launched in 1976, the
Briskovo zinc and lead mine project was supposed to boost the local economy
by reopening a Medieval mine that had provided silver for Serbia's first
coinage.
At its peak, the mine produced 4,500 tonnes of lead and zinc annually, but
only a small quantity of silver.
'It was considered a successful enterprise, bringing in about Dollars 6m
(Pounds 3.9m) a year, so nobody paid much attention to the effects of the
dump,' says Mr Borislav Medovejic, the director of the ore processing plant.
Up to 35,000 tonnes a year of sludge containing high levels of both zinc and
lead - as well as other heavy metals like mercury and cadmium were poured
into the dam. The dam, made of compacted sand and gravel, was lined with
thick plastic sheeting to prevent the metal residue from seeping into the
ground water. When production at the mine was stepped up in 1980, in
response to demand from Zorka Savac, the federal Yugoslav mineral exporting
company, the dam had to be enlarged.
'It's in the past two years that we really started to notice the effect of
living next to the dump.
'The number of lung cancer cases has doubled and there have been 18
suicides, which I attribute to the effect of mercury on the central nervous
system,' says Dr Radovan Jovanovic, head of the town's medical centre.
When the mine shut down last year, after the Yugoslavs lost their market in
the former Soviet Union, it looked as if Mojkovac's increasingly active
ecological association would at last get a hearing.
The republic's post-communist government is keen to underline its concern
for the environment. A plan was begun for covering the 20-hectare site with
a thick layer of clay and topsoil.
That scheme has now been overtaken by events. 'Even if we manage to secure
the dam, the waste cannot just be covered up. There is proably lead and zinc
left, because of inefficient extraction, to make further processing
commercially viable. But after that's done, it will still be very expensive
to make the site safe,' Mr Dolder said.

THE RACE TO AVOID DISASTER
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1   An estimated 3.5m tons of toxic waste - lead, zinc, cadmium,
    cyanide - contained by the 600m long Jaloviste dam alongside the
    Tara River in the mountains of Montenegro
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
2   The flood-swollen Tara damages 150 metres of the compaced sand and
    gravel dam last month, threatening to cause what UN officials say
    could become an 'absolute disaster'
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
3   The system of back-fill and stacked gabions - chicken wire cages
    filled with gravel or crushed stone - which UN engineers are now
    racing to erect by Christmas
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
4   At stake, say UN officials, is not only the poisoning of 'everything
    that lives' in the Tara, but 'probably in the Danube as well' as it
    flows from Belgrade to the Black Sea
