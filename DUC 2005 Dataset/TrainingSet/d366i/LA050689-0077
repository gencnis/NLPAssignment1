GOLD MINING AND WILDLIFE

What fool would pose such a question: "Should we allow a foreign interest to 
extract gold from the American soil of a proposed national park and leave us a 
seething, cyanide-laced toxic pit?" At best, the popularity of such a proposal 
is laughable. Unfortunately, the humor is lost both on the Bureau of Land 
Management as well as to our archaic and permissive General Mining Law of 1872.

The responses which predictably range from shock to incredulous disbelief tell 
us that Californians are not humored. The BLM hearing, which should have asked 
the question "whether," merely asked "how." But despite this breakdown of the 
representative process, thanks to the efforts of Levine and the environmental 
consciousness basic to almost all Americans, both the bureau and the Viceroy 
Resources Corp. will receive their unsolicited reply.
