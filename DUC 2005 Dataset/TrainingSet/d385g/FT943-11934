Ford is joining seven US-based advanced technology companies in a five-year,
Dollars 122m programme to develop prototype 'hybrid' electric vehicles.
Such vehicles are seen as possibly the best available compromise between the
need to reduce exhaust emissions, best achieved by electrically powered
vehicles, and the severely restricted range offered by battery cars using
current technology .
Half the funds for the project are to be provided by the US energy
department.
'Hybrids' contain two power units; one, typically a small petrol engine,
runs at a constant speed to generate electrical energy which is either
stored in battery packs for electric-only operation in cities or converted
by the second motor directly into mechanical energy for use on highways.
Ford said last night the project aimed to investigate methods of using
alternative fuels as well as increasing fuel economy and reducing emissions.
Ford's partners in the project include GE's research and development centre,
which will explore energy storage in the vehicles; and Minneapolis-based
Onan Corporation, one of the world's largest producers of mobile power
generation systems.
The project comes against a background of increasing hostility by the North
American motor industry towards stringent anti-pollution standards being
introduced in California.
These require carmakers to have at least 2 per cent of their sales made up
of 'zero-emission' (battery-powered) cars from 1998.
