horizon - John Griffiths finds Mazda pushing ahead with an emission-free
fuel

Mazda, Japan's fourth largest car maker, is shortly to seek Japanese
government approval for an on-highway test programme for hydrogen-powered
cars, whose exhaust 'fumes' consist of non-polluting steam.
The company has concluded that hydrogen-powered cars are technically
achievable more quickly than is commonly believed within the industry.
Over the coming months, it plans to start negotiations with Californian
state authorities on making hydrogen cars acceptable under the strict new
exhaust emissions legislation that California is phasing in from 1997
onwards, and to explore possible systems for refuelling them.
Part of the Californian legislation, which is being considered for adoption
by up to a dozen other states, requires 2 per cent of manufacturers' sales
to be of 'zero emission vehicles' from 1998, rising to 10 per cent by the
early 21st century.
Virtually the entire motor industry has accepted the fact that the
legislation's time scale can only be met with battery-powered cars.
But while Mazda has already developed its own battery cars to meet the
legislation, Michinori Yamanouchi, senior managing director of Mazda Motor
Corporation, says that electric vehicles in general will be far too
expensive and limited in their performance to have anything but a restricted
future as urban runabouts or light commercial vehicles.
According to Mazda, the Wankel rotary petrol engine - which it, alone among
car makers, now produces - can be adapted more easily than conventional
petrol engines to run on hydrogen. Cars fitted with it could reach the
marketplace for a price about 20 per cent higher than a petrol-powered
equivalent - 'in other words for about the cost of air conditioning and
audio equipment', says Yamanouchi.
In contrast, he says, 'we estimate that even if electric vehicle technology
really advanced, their price would be twice that of a gasolene car at
minimum. And that price ratio would be the same even if a manufacturer were
to be making 10,000 units a month'.
Mazda is by no means alone in researching hydrogen-fuelled cars. Mercedes
and BMW of Germany are among those which have produced prototypes.
However, difficulties with combustion in adapted, conventional reciprocating
engines and on-board fuel storage, and scepticism about the ease with which
a hydrogen manufacturing and refuelling infrastructure could be set up have
led most manufacturers to suggest that viable hydrogen cars are still years
off.
According to Mr Yamanouchi, the design of the rotary engine eliminates the
premature combustion problems normally associated with using hydrogen as a
fuel in conventional engines.
Mazda has also launched a collaborative project with Nippon Steel
Corporation, Japan's largest steel maker, to set up a pipeline fuelling
supply system for the test programme, using as the feedstock hydrogen from
one of Nippon Steel's manufacturing plants, where hydrogen is a major but
mostly wasted by-product.
Yamanouchi expects the steel industry to be a future producer and marketer
of hydrogen in its own right.
Chemical plants, which generate hydrogen as a by-product, could be also
harnessed to localised supply networks. In Japan there will be a network of
hydrogen fuelling stations by the early 21st century, he predicts.
Mazda's vision of a fuelling infrastructure for hydrogen is based on it
being in gaseous form. BMW, in contrast, has based its prototype on the use
of hydrogen in liquid form, requiring insulation of both fuelling system and
the vehicle's fuel tank to allow temperatures close to absolute zero.
'If the determination is there, we can set up hydrogen pumps and pipelines
fairly easily in terms of technology and finance,' Yamanouchi says.
He is also relatively dismissive of concerns about the safety aspects of
hydrogen, should it leak into a boot interior, for example. It is
undetectable by sight or smell, but Yamanouchi insists that, being lighter
than air, it would disperse quickly - and it possesses a combustion point
higher than gasolene.
Mazda regards the biggest problem as how to store the hydrogen in sufficient
volumes in the vehicle. Its solution, adopted also for the prototype
Mercedes fleet, is a fuel tank filled with a metallic hydride capable of
soaking up large quantities of gaseous hydrogen and re-releasing it when
heated.
Fitting enough hydrogen into the tank is still a problem, however, as it is
a much less dense fuel than gasolene. Nevertheless, one prototype has
achieved continuous running for 200km at maximum speeds of 150kph.
Yamanouchi's predicts that in 30 years, petrol or diesel-powered cars will
account for just 10 per cent of the world's total car output, having been
supplanted mainly by hydrogen cars but also by a much smaller proportion of
battery powered urban vehicles.
As for California's forthcoming legislation, Mazda believes that the
problems of limited range and performance of battery-powered cars, and even
their refuelling infrastructure, will become much more apparent as its
enactment draws nearer. It believes that California's Air Resources Board
and other legislative bodies involved will face a sea of difficulties in
persuading Californian motorists to buy and use them. 'Already, I have heard
that the ARB is feeling itself as Hamlet in Shakespeare,' says Yamanouchi.
Mazda therefore expects the Californian authorities to welcome the proposals
for a hydrogen alternative.
It is considering talking to other manufacturers that have an interest in
the technology for a co-operative approach to introducing hydrogen cars to
California.
Among those most likely to be interested is Mercedes, which last year
updated its thinking on hydrogen vehicles in the form of the F-100 concept,
shown as Mercedes' 'car of the future' at the Detroit motor show.
Even Mazda, however, acknowledges that production of hydrogen - on the huge
scale required to provide significant substitution for petroleum - is a
large technical challenge.
Hydrogen may be the most abundant element in the universe, and the ninth
most abundant on earth, but making it from water - the most sensible route
on a large scale - involves electrolysis, using a direct external energy
source. Clearly, if the energy to provide this came from fossil fuels, the
whole exercise could be self-defeating from both the emissions and energy
conservation points of view.
For large parts of the transport-using world - not least sunny California -
solar energy could prove the answer. One group highly active in the field,
Texas Instruments, claims already to be generating solar electricity at
close to the domestic tariff rate of Southern California Edison, the
electric utility.
