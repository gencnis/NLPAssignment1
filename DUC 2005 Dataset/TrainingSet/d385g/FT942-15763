Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial group, yesterday unveiled an
experimental hydrogen-powered electric van which runs on fuel cells,
converting chemicals directly into electricity without the need to burn
fossil fuels. Daimler-Benz is among several companies in Japan, the US and
elsewhere working on fuel cell technology for transport and power
generation. In the production of the van, Daimler-Benz co-operated with
Ballard Power Systems of Canada, which developed a fuel-cell bus operating
in Vancouver.
This technology utilises highly efficient electricity production without
noxious exhaust gasses and with less carbon dioxide than conventional
engines. The equipment is still too heavy and the cost too high for fuel
cells to enter commercial use yet. Mr Firoz Rasul, president of Ballard,
said it would take less than 10 years for the problems to be resolved,
adding that California's tough new emission laws would act as an important
spur to fuel cell technology.
