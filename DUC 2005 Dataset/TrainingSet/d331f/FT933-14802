THE World Bank has increased its budget for supervision activities by 12 per
cent for the current year as part of its efforts to improve the
effectiveness of its lending.
Mr Ernest Stern, a World Bank managing director and acting president while
Mr Lewis Preston, the president, is recovering from surgery, said yesterday
the new action plan agreed at a board meeting last week would accelerate a
cultural change within the bank and should help to improve the management of
the 1,850 projects in its portfolio.
'Central to the plan is the commitment to make the management of projects
under implementation as important as making new loans. Only sound,
on-the-ground results - the development impact of projects - are true
measures of the bank's contribution to sustainable development,' Mr Stern
said.
The new action plan comes in response to last year's report by a taskforce
which identified a sharp decline in the quality of the bank's portfolio,
with particular problems in Africa and in the agricultural sector.
At the heart of the plan is a determination to manage the bank's portfolio
of projects within each country as a unit, instead of project by project.
Mr Stern said country reviews would in future be conducted annually for big
borrower countries, and on a regular basis for smaller borrowers.
Over half of the bank's biggest country portfolios, however, have already
undergone review, and as a result a number of projects have been cancelled
or redesigned.
In India, a review led to the cancellation of projects totalling Dollars
1.3bn (Pounds 866m).
Mr Stern insisted, however, that the basic responsibility for ensuring that
projects were properly implemented lay with the borrower, not the bank.
