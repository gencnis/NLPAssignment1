A leading British charity yesterday called for 'an open acknowledgment of
the scale of sub-Saharan Africa's development fail-ure'.
In a strongly-worded attack on the World Bank's latest report on the region,
Oxfam said that bank-supported structural adjustment programmes had failed
to 'generate sustainable growth and significantly reduce poverty'.
The charity, which is heavily involved in Africa, declared that adjustment
programmes 'were preoccupied with lowering inflation through interest rates
and unrealistic money supply targets.
'Poorly planned and sequenced import liberalisation measures' had 'exposed
potentially competitive local industries to ruinous competition from
imports' Oxfam said in its statement.
The British charity accused the bank of 'complacency' in the face of what it
called Africa's 'deepening development crisis'.
The charity also attacked the bank's classification in its report of
Zimbabwe as a successful adjusting country as 'bordering on outright
deception'.
Zimbabwe's adjustment programme did not come until operation until 1991,
says Oxfam: 'Since when there has been no sign of recovery in investment or
export growth'.
