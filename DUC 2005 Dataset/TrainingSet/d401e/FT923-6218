PERSONS persecuted on political grounds shall enjoy the right to asylum: 11
words in Germany's inadequate constitution, liberally interpreted by
politicians, exploited by thousands of poor foreigners looking for a new
life, and scorned by blood-hungry yobs and Nazis old and new, brought mass
violence to the streets of Rostock at the weekend.
The fear and the likelihood is that such scenes will be repeated elsewhere
in the coming weeks and months; most likely in the east.
The weekend beatings and burnings which spilled over into Monday night - a
magnified reflection of the extreme right's offensive in Hoyerswerda,
Saxony, almost exactly a year ago - stirred shame and recrimination in equal
measure among politicians yesterday.
The violence, cheered by mobs of 'respectable' locals in the apartment
blocks around the besieged asylum hostel in the Lichtenhagen suburb, also
sharpened the desire to find a solution.
By grim coincidence, while the alleged radio-equipped 'organisers' of the
battle were on their way to Rostock from Berlin, Hamburg and other
inner-city spawning grounds of the far-right, Mr Bjorn Engholm, leader of
the opposition Social Democrats, was preparing to stand his party's asylum
policy on its head.
Ringing through the ifs and buts of his weekend declaration came unequivocal
acceptance that the uncontrolled flow of asylum-seekers - 233,000 in the
first seven months of this year, compared with 256,000 during 1991 and
193,000 in 1990 - had to be stopped.
After years of refusal, the party leadership was prepared to countenance
constitutional change.
The 'ideologues' in Bonn had, after all, heard the voices of grass-roots
party leaders in the hundreds of SPD-controlled local and state governments
who have daily to house, feed, process and protect asylum claimants, a
senior Christian Democrat leader said.
Chancellor-candidate Mr Engholm insisted yesterday that he was not trying to
protect his career.
'This concerns the political reaction to current problems which need to be
dealt with,' he said.
One of the problems now in need of treatment has been current since the
adoption of the constitution in 1949. Although the 11-word paragraph laying
down the basic law on asylum seems clear enough, implementation has been
conditioned (by hitherto common consent) by Germany's xenophobic and
genocidal past.
In practice, anyone asking for asylum at the border is allowed in. After
examination of each case, sometimes lasting months, fewer than 5 per cent of
applicants are approved.
The fact that there are almost 6m foreigners living and working in the
federal republic, most for 10 years and more, is often cited to support
frequent claims from Bonn politicians that Germany is 'foreigner-friendly'.
But most came originally to enjoy better living standards at Germany's
convenience. Many were invited as 'guest workers', to dig coal and labour in
service jobs spurned by Germans.
Now, in the words of Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister, people coming in
search of a better life 'abuse' the asylum laws. Now, in the words of the
extreme right-wing German People's Union, 'Das Boot ist voll (The boat is
full).'
The recent sudden upsurge in asylum-seekers is exerting unmanageable
pressures on local budgets and generating uncontainable social forces,
exacerbated by hard-core neo-Nazis and hooligans, especially in unemployment
hot-spots in east German towns. The influx of ethnic Germans from the former
Soviet Union and elsewhere in eastern Europe (250,000 last year) has added
to the strains.
Eastern local authorities, lacking funds to provide other accommodation,
tend to house their asylum-seeker quotas in heavily populated areas.
Protection, such as it is, comes from inexperienced police, mostly new
recruits who have inherited the mantle of popular hatred handed down by
their communist predecessors.
Official jobless figures in such places range around 20 per cent, but
estates such as Lichtenhagen house up to another 30 per cent one-time
workers, pensioned off into early retirement or 'employed' on non-productive
fill-in projects funded by Bonn until real jobs can be found.
Now, with recession looming over the western economy and no sign of a
resurgence in industrial ruins in the east, the prospect of real jobs is
fading - like Chancellor Helmut Kohl's vision of a 'blooming landscape' in
the former GDR - into the far distance.
A much more tangible possibility is recession, rising unemployment, and
mounting social and political disorder. After last weekend's events Bonn may
act quickly to slow the flow of immigrants and skim away some of the surface
tensions. The risk is that in the process it will expose the underlying
roots of dissent. A country still divided economically, socially and
mentally - with or without its sad traffic in bemused economic refugees -
will continue to provide a bountiful feeding ground for extremists.
