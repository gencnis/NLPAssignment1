THE malaise in Turkish/German relations, with Bonn suspending arms shipments
over the alleged use of German military aid to put down Kurdish
demonstrations, owes something to the realisation on both sides that the
special relationship is over.
Historically, Germany has been Turkey's main European ally. The two fought
together in the First World War.
More recently the relationship has been cemented by economic links. In the
growth years of the last three decades Turkish Gastarbeiter (guest workers)
have played a vital role in both economies, particularly for Turkey. Turkish
workers last year sent home Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 860m).
However, the relationship is souring. Turkish feathers were ruffled during
the Gulf War, when Germany initially failed to respond to Turkey's request
for military aid, in the end sending eight Alpha jets.
Behind the malaise is the realisation that, following German unification and
developments in eastern Europe, Turkey is less important to Germany as an
economic partner. Germany's dependence on Turkish labour has lessened.
Indeed German aid is used as subsidised credits to entice Turkish workers
home. Although DM13m (Pounds 4.5m) has been spent on rehabilitation and
business schemes, as many as 1.5m Turks seem determined to stay permanently
in Germany.
Many guestworkers, perhaps 400,000, are of Kurdish origin. They provide much
of the financial support for the separatist Kurdish Workers party whose
political wing operates openly in Germany. Ankara has repeatedly called on
Bonn to ban their activities.
Yesterday's crisis follows television reports from south-east Turkey showing
Turkish security forces using old east German armoured vehicles to attack
Kurdish demonstrators. Most worrying for Ankara is the linking of the
Kurdish issue to EC membership for Turkey.
