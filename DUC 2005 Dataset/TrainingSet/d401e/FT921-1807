GERMAN police said yesterday they had detained 67 people after anarchists,
many of them masked, hurled rocks and smashed car windows at an anti-racism
demonstration in the eastern city of Leipzig, Reuter reports.
Leipzig city police said 17 officers were slightly injured after 900
policemen, reinforced by paramilitary border guards, used water cannon and
truncheons on Saturday to drive the 400 anarchists away from the city
centre.
Witnesses saw several demonstrators with blood streaming down their faces
from head wounds but the police did not give any figures for the number
hurt.
A police helicopter was struck several times by fireworks hurled by the
demonstrators. Anarchists set car tyres and rubbish containers alight as
they fought behind hastily erected barricades.
Fifteen people were under investigation for illegal possession of arms and
damaging property, police said.
The riot, the biggest in the former communist east Germany since
left-wingers fought police in Halle last November, occurred after a peaceful
demonstration by around 1,000 people.
Carrying banners saying 'Foreigners in, Nazis out', they protested against
another rally in the city organised by the National Offensive, an extreme
right-wing group.
Police said they found a petrol bomb hidden in the square where the neo-Nazi
rally was to start later.
Some 300 right-wingers chanting Adolf Hitler's slogan 'One people, one
Reich, one Fuhrer' and giving the illegal Nazi salute later marched through
central Leipzig.
