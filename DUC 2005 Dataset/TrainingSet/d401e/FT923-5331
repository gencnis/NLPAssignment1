GERMAN politicians are warning of a possible foreign boycott of German
products and a halt in investments in east Germany as a result of continuing
militant rightwing attacks on asylum seekers in the East.
Mr Heiner Geissler, deputy parliamentary leader of the Christian Democratic
(CDU-CSU) party, yesterday cautioned against the danger of a boycott if
people believed internationally that racism was being resurrected in
Germany.
'Every third job (in Germany) is dependent on foreigners buying our goods,'
Mr Geissler said.
This week right-wing militants in Brandenburg, which surrounds Berlin,
assaulted hostels for asylum seekers in Cottbus and two other towns.
Brandenburg had previously attracted pledges of considerable foreign
investment and was held in high esteem among its foreign partners, he said.
More than 100 policemen in Cottbus prevented almost as many young extremists
on Monday night from assaulting a hostel filled with nearly 1,000 asylum
seekers. The youths had attacked the hostel on the previous three nights.
Young right-wingers also threw stones at a hostel housing mainly Romanian
gypsies near Leipzig who had fled there after their tents were set afire on
Sunday.
A group of youths also hurled Molotov cocktails and paving stones on Monday
night at a hostel for foreigners in Lubz in the state of
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
The attacks against asylum seekers began there last week in Rostock.
The previous night a monument in Berlin to tens of thousands of Jews sent to
the death camps by train from 1940 to 1944 was badly damaged by explosives.
Mr Eberhard Diepgen, Berlin's Mayor, condemned the attack as an 'ugly
provocation.'
Mr Rudolf Seiters, the German Interior Minister, announced at an emergency
meeting on Monday that Bonn would strongly support the five east German
states in setting up special police and surveillance units to combat
extremism.
