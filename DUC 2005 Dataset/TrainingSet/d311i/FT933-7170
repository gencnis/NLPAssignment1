VOLKSWAGEN chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech, yesterday stepped up his attempt to
draw the Bonn government into the group's clash with Adam Opel, General
Motors' German subsidiary.
He is understood to have telephoned Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister,
for a 'continuation' of face-to-face talks held in Berlin last Friday.
Although the contents of last week's meetings were secret - the minister met
Mr David Herman, Opel chairman, on Tuesday - Mr Rexrodt said at the weekend
he was 'optimistic' he could tone down the war of words.
He appears to have accepted the role of mediator despite his initial claims
that that he wanted only to gather information.
While there are clear dangers for a politician becoming involved in a
potentially explosive legal issue, Mr Rexrodt is anxious that the
inter-company conflict does not blow up into a clash between Washington and
Bonn.
The minister's 'optimism' suggests Mr Piech and his colleagues are prepared
 -at a price - to apologise publicly for charges that Opel was acting as
agent provocateur in a US-inspired 'war' against its domestic rival, and
suggestions that it could have planted evidence with the aim of
incriminating its employees.
In return Mr Piech is expected to demand that Opel officials stop all press
communications on their suspicions and also call a halt to the current
criminal investigations against Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the VW
production director, and three of his associates.
VW stopped commenting on the theft and industrial espionage probe more than
a week ago, when it refused even to deny new media allegations that 11 of
its employees transferred confidential Opel data in Volkswagen computers.
General Motors officials have persistently refused to talk peacefully while
VW failed to withdraw its charges, stressing that their legal complaints had
made no mention of VW itself.
