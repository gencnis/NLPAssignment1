FT  23 JUL 93 / Volkswagen's reply: Discovery of data seen as link with
ex-GM executive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Excerpts from the statement issued by Volkswagen:
the investigation relates to documents which were not at the disposal of
Volkswagen AG.
2. Volkswagen AG cannot comment on details of the press release issued by
the Darmstadt Public Prosecutor's Office. Despite numerous requests to
inspect the contents of the boxes, to date the defence counsel of the
affected employee, who has again confirmed that no secret documents of Opel
AG or General Motors Corporation had been found in his possession, has been
denied access. The conduct of the Public Prosecutor's Office has thereby
prevented the employee from giving his views on the contents of the box.
Evidently the Public Prosecutor's Office can only base its assessment of the
contents of the boxes on information from Adam Opel AG/GM Corporation, which
makes it completely one-sided.
3. The comments of the Public Prosecutor's Office that Mr Lopez had part of
the documents translated into German is easily explained: managers who
operate on a global basis naturally have talks and presentations translated
into the local language.
The press release by the Public Prosecutor's Office does not give the
supervisory and management boards of VW any reason to reproach Mr Lopez.
