Argentina and Britain announced an agreement Thursday to restore full 
diplomatic ties, nearly eight years after they fought a 74-day war over the 
Falkland Islands, a sparsely populated archipelago off Argentina's coast in the 
South Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement capped two days of talks here between Argentine and British 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Britain agreed to lift by March 31 a 150-mile military protection zone enforced 
around the islands since Argentina invaded them in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The pact calls for advance notice by each side of military exercises around the 
islands, which are home to about 1,900 people. 
</P>
<P>
In the war over the islands, called the Malvinas by Argentina, 712 Argentines, 
255 Britons and three islanders died. London and Buenos Aires broke diplomatic 
relations during the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement announced Thursday stipulated that talks will continue between 
the two nations on fishing around the islands -- an important source of revenue 
-- and that the International Red Cross will work out visits by Argentines to 
war cemeteries in the Falklands. 
</P>
<P>
By mutual consent, the latest talks did not touch on claims to sovereignty over 
the Falklands, which Argentina and Britain have disputed since 1833.
