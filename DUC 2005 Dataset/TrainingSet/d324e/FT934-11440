ARGENTINA'S foreign minister, Mr Guido di Tella, begins a three-day official
visit to Britain today, the second by an Argentine minister this year and an
indication of rapidly improving ties.
He will see Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary.
In September, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, made the first official
trip to Britain by a minister since the 1982 Falklands war. Three British
cabinet ministers have visited Buenos Aires this year.
Relations began improving after President Carlos Menem took office in 1989
and adopted pro-western foreign policies and free market economics. However,
the unresolved dispute over the Falklands means that Mr Menem is unlikely to
be invited to London soon.
The two sides have agreed on other questions, principally fisheries. Mr Di
Tella will sign a new one-year fishing agreement.
