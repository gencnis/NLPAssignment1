BRITAIN'S Export Credits Guarantee Department is resuming export insurance
cover to Argentina, 11 years after its suspension following the 1982
Falklands conflict and the onset of Argentina's decade-long debt crisis,
writes John Barham in Buenos Aires.
Mr Michael Heseltine, UK trade and industry secretary, who is on an official
visit to Argentina, said this had been made possible by the 'substantial
improvement in the way Argentina has been servicing its debts'.
British exporters have been clamouring for ECGD cover as economic conditions
improve in Argentina. Although Argentina's free market reforms have led to a
substantial increase in imports, British sales remain depressed; exports
rose to Pounds 118.7m in 1992 from Pounds 69.7m in 1991.
Exporters are likely to be disappointed by the Pounds 100m ceiling on
coverage and the high premiums, expected to be in the range of 14 per cent.
Officials said this reflected Argentina's poor debt repayment record and
high risk of insolvency or non-payment.
