ARGENTINA'S foreign minister, Mr Guido di Tella, begins a three-day official
visit to Britain today, the second by an Argentine minister this year and an
indication of rapidly improving ties.
He will see Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary. He will also
meet opposition politicians and business leaders.
In September, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, made the first official
trip to Britain by a minister since the 1982 Falklands war. Three British
cabinet ministers have visited Buenos Aires this year.
Relations began improving after President Carlos Menem took office in 1989
and adopted pro-western foreign policies and free market economics. However,
the unresolved dispute over the Falklands means that Mr Menem is unlikely to
be invited to London soon.
Mr Di Tella is trying to win over the Falkland islanders by convincing them
that Argentina has changed for the better. He has met Falkland
representatives and broadcast to the islands via the BBC World Service. But
suspicious Falklanders reject his advances and Britain refuses to discuss
the islands' political future.
The two sides have agreed on other questions, principally fisheries, the
Falklands' main source of revenue. Mr Di Tella will sign a new one-year
fishing agreement.
However, Britain refuses to lift its arms embargo preventing Argentina from
replacing aircraft shot down in 1982.
