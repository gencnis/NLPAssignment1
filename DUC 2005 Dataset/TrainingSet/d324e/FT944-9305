FT  16 NOV 94 / Observer: Hands off Argentina
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Today Argentina gets out the red carpet for the UK's Duke of York, the first
official royal visitor since the end of the Anglo-Argentine Falklands war in
1982.
Prince Andrew, a helicopter pilot in that war, today re-inaugurates in
Buenos Aires a statue of 19th century British statesman George Canning,
which had its hands lopped off by anti-British protestors in 1982, when the
statue itself fell.
Disagreement lingers over what exactly happened to the statue, once toppled.
The British say Canning was stored away. Argentina's federation of war
veterans says the 'great English thief' was 'deposited in the murky waters
of the River Plate as an act of repudiation against British imperialism'.
And what of Canning's hands? Have the originals been re-affixed, or are they
tucked away in a Buenos Aires apartment? 'You can rest assured that it will
not be a statue without hands,' is the signal from the Foreign Office.
