MR DOMINGO CAVALLO, Argentina's economy minister and architect of one of the
world's most surprising economic miracles, arrives in London this morning
for a three-day visit.
Mr Cavallo, the first Argentine cabinet minister to make an official visit
to Britain since the 1982 Falklands conflict, will meet Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor of the exchequer, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England.
The visit confirms the rapidly improving ties between the UK and Argentina
since President Carlos Menem took office in 1989 and adopted pro-western
foreign policies and free market economics. Mr Cavallo became economy
minister in 1991 and rapidly transformed Argentina into one of the world's
fastest-growing economies. However, the unresolved dispute over the
Falklands - which Argentina still claims - means that no date is likely to
be set soon for a visit by Mr Menem.
As well as meeting UK government officials, Mr Cavallo will give a lecture
at the London School of Economics and a speech at the Confederation of
British Industry. He will also chair a seminar with potential investors at
Baring Brothers, the merchant bank with a long, if turbulent, history of
business with Argentina.
Britain has shown growing interest in Latin America as economic reforms
across the continent create new trade and investment opportunities. British
banks and companies, notably British Gas, have been active in Argentina's
privatisation programme.
Mr Cavallo's arrival in London follows a flurry of visits by senior British
ministers. Earlier this year Mr Hurd and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, visited Buenos Aires. Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture
minister, arrives in Argentina on Saturday for a brief official visit and Mr
Guido di Tella, Argentina's foreign minister, will visit London in November.
