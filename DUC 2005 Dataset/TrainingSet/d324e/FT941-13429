The British government has indicated its readiness to allow Argentine
companies to take part in the development of oilfields in the Falkland
islands' territorial waters - provided they acknowledge that any oil
extracted belongs to Britain.
Government sources think it unlikely that Argentine interests will end up
operating installations on the islands themselves, but believe Argentina's
coast could be a logical site for support operations.
Preliminary results from seismic surveys conducted last year around the
Falklands suggested the possibility of finding oil across a zone 25 per cent
larger than the North Sea.
The disclosure of Britain's position follows a recent request from Buenos
Aires for a meeting of senior foreign ministry officials to discuss joint
development of oil resources. London has yet to agree to this meeting.
Reaching an oil accord with the UK is Argentina's next important policy
objective, but it is unlikely to accept terms that implicitly recognise
Britain's sovereignty over the islands. Buenos Aires has used recent talks
on fish to press for a role in the development of possible oil and gas
reserves. British Gas said last year it had discussed joint offshore
exploration close to the disputed waters with YPF, Argentina's state-owned
oil company.
Some Falkland islanders are said to recognise that rapprochement with
Argentina would probably be necessary if an oil industry were to be
developed.
Recent developments come against a background of steadily improving
relations between the two former belligerents.
A year ago, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, became the first UK cabinet
minister to visit Argentina since the 1982 Falkland islands conflict.
Since then both Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, and Mr
Guido Di Tella, foreign minister, have visited Britain.
