Argentina is hoping to attract UK investment in its soon-to-be privatised
nuclear industry, as a result of a series of contacts at government and
company level, according to senior officials.
Mr Carlos Bastos, Argentine energy minister, has been in London this week on
an official visit which marks a further step in the normalisation of
UK-Argentine relations since the Falklands War in 1982.
Mr Bastos, who was invited to the UK by the foreign office, met his
counterpart at the department of trade and industry, Mr Timothy Eggar.
The department described the talks as 'friendly and constructive,' but
refused detailed comment.
Argentine officials say their country has no political objections to British
companies operating its two nuclear power stations, Atucha I and Atucha II.
Argentina has also offered to co-operate with international research and
development of a cost-effective, safe standard nuclear reactor.
