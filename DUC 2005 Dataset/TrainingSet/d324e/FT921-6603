BRITAIN and Argentina yesterday began discussions in Buenos Aires on
developing oil resources in the South Atlantic, writes John Barham from
Buenos Aires.
The talks, expected to last two to three days, are the first formal
negotiations on the most challenging and complex issue facing the two sides,
apart from the central question of sovereignty over the Falkland Islands.
It has long been rumoured that the seabed around the islands holds large oil
reserves. However, there has been no exploration in the region since an
inconclusive survey in the 1970s.
Last year, London authorised the local Falkland Islands government to issue
seismic exploration licences, bringing the fraught issue of oil resources to
the fore.
If oil is found in commercial quantities around the islands, co-operation
with Argentina would be essential to develop the reserves. Major gasfields
have been found in Argentine waters between Tierra de Fuego and the
Falklands, but, so far, little oil has been found.
Although both sides will use this week's talks to set out their points of
view, issues such as harmonisation of legislation, law enforcement,
taxation, environmental policies and the demarcation of zones are yet to be
addressed. Inevitably, they will touch either directly or indirectly on the
sensitive issue of sovereignty.
The islands' councillors have yet to pass any oil legislation. Their laws
will depend on the outcome of the talks with Buenos Aires. However,
Argentina does not recognise the Falklands' local government.
