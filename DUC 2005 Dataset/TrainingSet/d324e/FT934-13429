BRITAIN AND Argentina have reached a new agreement on sharing fish resources
in the South Atlantic and waters surrounding the Falkland islands after two
days of talks in Buenos Aires.
The one-year arrangement favours Argentina, which will increase its share of
a substantially extended fishing effort next year - raising its catch of the
prized illex squid by 70 per cent to 220,000 tonnes. The Falklands will
retain its present quota of 150,000 tonnes.
The agreement is to be signed in London early next month during an official
visit by Foreign Minister Guido di Tella, in which Argentina's claims to the
islands will inevitably feature prominently on the agenda.
The accord will increase pressure on the islands' financial revenues, which
depend heavily on the sale of fishing licences. The islands' government
forecasts a 35 per cent fall in licence revenue next year to between Pounds
15m and Pounds 15.5m.
Argentine negotiators say, however, that 'the islands could not delude
themselves that we would never develop our fishing industry. This agreement
allows them to plan ahead'.
Argentina is likely to continue increasing its share of the catch in future
years.
Britain had hoped to strike a long-term agreement with Argentina that would
protect the islands' revenues. But Argentina is tying such an agreement to
concessions by London over shared development of the islands' possible oil
reserves and the lifting of the UK's arms embargo, imposed during the 1982
Falklands conflict.
