</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elizabeth Mazivire, a 16-year-old mother of three, works in the tobacco barn of 
a wealthy Zimbabwean farmer to supplement the earnings of her tractor-driver 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
Her eldest son, Peter, is only 4 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Weary, and looking far older than her age, Elizabeth says she "accidentally 
fell pregnant" at 12 and since then has continued having accidental pregnancies 
by her 20-year-old husband, Jonathan. 
</P>
<P>
She is one of thousands of Zimbabwean women who, either because they do not 
know about contraceptives or have no access to them, end up having more 
children than planned. 
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, with only 9 million people in a country the size of France, hardly 
ranks as overcrowded. But here, as almost everywhere in Africa, a high birth 
rate is threatening to wipe out modest gains from economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe and neighboring Botswana have been spotlighted by the World Bank as 
the only two countries in sub-Saharan Africa where vigorous government efforts 
to promote family planning are starting to show results. 
</P>
<P>
About 40% of Zimbabwean couples now use contraceptives -- about 10 times the 
African average, according to the World Bank. Only Mauritius, an Indian Ocean 
island not typical of Africa, scores higher, with 78%. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Zimbabwe is still fighting an uphill battle against the African 
tradition of large families. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1980 and 1987 the net population growth was 3.7%, although the latest 
figures show a drop to 2.9%. World Bank statistics show that as recently as 
1988, the average Zimbabwean woman could expect to give birth to five children 
in her lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
Population growth has far outpaced Zimbabwe's annual average economic growth 
rate of 2.4% since independence in 1980, according to World Bank statistics. 
</P>
<P>
This has led to an average drop in the per capita gross domestic product of 
1.3% a year, with falling living standards, growing unemployment and increased 
pressure on social services. 
</P>
<P>
In much of Africa the figures are far worse. World Bank projections foresee a 
doubling of the continent's population to 1 billion in the next 30 years, and 
at the moment only 3% to 4% of couples use contraception. 
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe accidental pregnancies are most prevalent among schoolgirls who, 
for moral reasons, are barred by the authorities from freely obtaining 
contraceptives like their married and adult counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
But teen-agers and couples who do not use any form of modern contraception for 
cultural, religious and other reasons are now the main targets of a 
state-backed family planning program. 
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council has expanded its activities since 
independence to almost every town and has established a rural network in which 
contraceptives are given freely to couples and unmarried adults. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the nerve center of the country's population control strategy," said a 
spokeswoman of the council, which gets 70% of its funds from the government. 
</P>
<P>
The council holds lectures for couples on why and how to space their children 
and counseling sessions for young people on the consequences of early marriage. 
</P>
<P>
However, the campaign to persuade families to have fewer children has yet to 
reach every corner of the country, particularly isolated rural areas where 80% 
of Zimbabwe's population lives. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth, for example, despite living on a farm only 40 miles from the 
capital, said she had never heard of contraceptives until "a few weeks ago, 
when I went to Harare for specialized medical treatment." 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I knew there was this (contraceptives) and I think I couldn't have 
fallen pregnant in the first place and I could have been in school now," she 
said with a wry smile. 
</P>
<P>
Rural families, who rely on children to work on their farms, have an average of 
eight children. Before the advent of modern medical care, infant mortality 
encouraged women to have a large number of pregnancies to ensure that several 
children survived.
