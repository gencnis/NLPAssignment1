NATO and the Warsaw Pact agreed in principle today to a treaty drastically 
slashing their Cold War arsenals of non-nuclear weapons, delegates said. 
</P>
<P>
The 22 nations represented at the Conventional Forces in Europe talks then 
began cleaning up the 200-page text, which sets ceilings on the number of 
weapons each alliance can hold. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty, the first covering conventional arms since World War II, is to be 
formally initialed in Vienna on Sunday and signed a day later in Paris at a 
34-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Agreement on the treaty, far from certain as recently as a few weeks ago, 
clears the way to full participation at the Paris summit. The United States had 
said it would not attend unless the treaty was certain to be approved. 
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, described as the most far-reaching and complex arms accord 
ever negotiated, each alliance will be limited to 20,000 tanks, 30,000 armored 
cars, 20,000 artillery pieces, 6,800 combat aircraft and 2,000 attack 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
The ceilings will be divided between four zones in the area under negotiation, 
a vast tract of 2.3 million square miles stretching from the Atlantic to the 
Urals. 
</P>
<P>
Under the overall ceilings, each country will have its own national limit. To 
reach these ceilings, nations will have to scrap or convert to peaceful use a 
quarter of a million arms, in some cases up to half of current stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow will have to get rid of 19,000 tanks to meet the new limit. 
</P>
<P>
Talks will start immediately after the summit on a second-stage agreement that 
will set ceilings on the number of troops deployed by both sides.
