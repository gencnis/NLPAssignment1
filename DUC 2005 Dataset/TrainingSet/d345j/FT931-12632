PHILIP Morris, the large tobacco, food and beer manufacturer, yesterday
reported a 17.5 per cent increase in after-tax profits last year, before the
effect of accounting changes, to Dollars 4.93bn.
The result was scored on a 4.7 per cent rise in operating revenues, at
Dollars 59.1bn.
In the fourth quarter alone, Philip Morris posted after-tax earnings of
Dollars 1.2bn. This compared with Dollars 767m last time, but the previous
year's figure was depressed by a Dollars 455m charge to cover restructuring
in the food division.
Operating revenue in the final quarter rose from Dollars 13.7bn in 1991 to
Dollars 14.9bn last year - an 8.9 per cent improvement.
Philip Morris's earnings per share last year stood at Dollars 5.45, up by 20
per cent over the 1991 (again, before accounting-related charges).
The company had already signalled that it expected a rise of one-fifth in
earnings per share, and the shares edged ahead only Dollars  1/8 on the news
to Dollars 73 5/8 before the close.
Mr Michael Miles, Philip Morris's chairman, said the group was 'optimistic'
about prospects for 1993. He based this view on 'our growth and productivity
initiatives, increasing volume momentum, and a narrowing of price gaps in a
number of our key categories'.
Philip Morris surprised the stock market at the time of its third-quarter
results when it revealed that cigarette shipments, in volume terms, had
fallen slightly, and were expected to dip further in the fourth quarter.
Yesterday, it said that cigarette volume for the full-year was down by 0.5
per cent, mainly due the previously-announced stock adjustments in domestic
shipments and lower level of Russian exports.
Within this aggregate figure, domestic shipments fell 2.9 per cent, and
Philip Morris's US market share declined by 1.1 percentage points, to 42.3
per cent.
However, operating profit for the domestic tobacco business was up by 8.6
per cent at Dollars 5.2bn, on a 3.6 per cent increase in revenues, at
Dollars 12bn.
Operating profit from the international tobacco business also advanced
strongly, by 19.1 per cent to Dollars 2bn, on revenues up by 11.6 per cent
at Dollars 13.7bn.
Operating profits from the food businesses overall showed a 10.6 per cent
advance at Dollars 3.3bn, with sales improving by a more modest 3.1 per
cent, at Dollars 29bn.
The Miller Brewing Company, however, turned in a 13.6 per cent decline in
operating profit, at Dollars 260m, on sales 2 per cent lower at Dollars 4bn.
