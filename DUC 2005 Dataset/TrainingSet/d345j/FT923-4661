PHILIP Morris, the US tobacco group, yesterday unveiled an agreement to
build a factory to produce Marlboro cigarettes in the St Petersburg region
in Russia.
The deal with the regional administration is to set up a factory near the
town of Vyborg, employing at least 600 workers and costing 'several dozen'
million dollars.
It follows a similar agreement reached by RJR Nabisco, the US tobacco and
foods group, to produce other well-known western brands in the same part of
Russia.
The Philip Morris target is to produce 10bn cigarettes a year at the
factory, which is expected to be completed towards the end of 1993.
Yesterday's announcement in St Petersburg was preceded by a marketing
campaign in Russia's second city, with kiosks selling Marlboro at less than
the price charged by new private Russian businesses and glossy adverts
appearing in the local subway.
On Tuesday, Philip Morris executives met Russian government officials to
discuss ways in which Russia might repay a debt of Dollars 98.7m worth of
cigarettes delivered in 1991 after Moscow was hit by 'tobacco riots' as a
result of a domestic shortages.
Strapped for hard currency, Russia has offered to repay the debt with a
combination of raw materials, real estate and roubles.
Marlboro is currently manufactured in Samara as part of the Constellation
joint venture between Philip Morris, the Samara Tobacco Factory and the
AvtoVaz Industrial Corp.
