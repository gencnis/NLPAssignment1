Strong growth in overseas cigarette sales helped RJR Nabisco, the US food
and tobacco group, compensate for the continuing effects of lower prices in
the domestic market in its first quarter.
Net income fell by 8 per cent from the comparable quarter's Dollars 210m to
Dollars 194m before extraordinary items. The latest figure, however,
included a one-time tax benefit of Dollars 20m. At the pre-tax level,
profits fell by 11 per cent to Dollars 329m from Dollars 370m
Sales were down to Dollars 3.57bn from Dollars 3.74bn and earnings per
share, fully diluted and excluding extraordinary items, were down 25 per
cent to 12 cents from 16 cents.
The figures are the last that will suffer from an unfavourable comparison
with quarters preceding last year's so-called 'Marlboro Friday', when Philip
Morris prompted a price war by cutting the price of its premium brands.
RJR Nabisco said international tobacco volumes rose by 12 per cent, with
strong performances in western Europe, the former Soviet Union and Canada.
The company planned to start manufacturing in the Czech Republic.
International tobacco sales were up 4 per cent at Dollars 727m and operating
profits rose by 13 per cent to Dollars 179m.
Domestic tobacco volume was 9 per cent lower than in last year's first
quarter and sales, at Dollars 1.13bn, were 19 per cent lower. Operating
profit was down 21 per cent at Dollars 393m.
However, domestic tobacco margins rebounded almost to the comparable
quarter's levels. Although its low-cost brands lost volume, sales of its
premium brands like Camel and Winston were almost the same, reflecting the
company's decision to concentrate on profitability.
The Nabisco foods division increased operating profits by 13 per cent to
Dollars 230m, with Nabisco Biscuit doing well from new, reduced-fat versions
of its cookie and cracker brands.
