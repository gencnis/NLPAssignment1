FT  31 JAN 92 / Smoke signals give encouragement: The international
cigarette companies are targeting new markets

Growth prospects are now opening for international cigarette companies that
would have been regarded as a pipe-dream a decade ago. Political change in
eastern Europe and the removal of trade barriers in the Far East have given
the four multinationals - Philip Morris, BAT Industries, R J Reynolds and
Rothmans International - access to big potential new markets.
Ten years ago, the world market amounted to 4,500bn cigarettes. But more
than 60 per cent of that was virtually closed to the multinationals by
communist and non-communist state monopolies.
Today, world consumption of cigarettes is 20 per cent greater at 5,400bn;
and western tobacco companies are barred from less than 5 per cent of it.
Sir Pat Sheehy, chairman of BAT, says the prospects for international
companies are better than at any time during his 40 years in the industry.
The group's exports have risen from 45bn cigarettes in 1986 to 86bn in 1990.
Philip Morris, the tobacco exports of which already contribute Dollars 3bn
to the US balance of payments, says: 'The potential for our business
overseas is phenomenal.' The group plans a Dollars 3bn investment programme
over the next five years to increase its worldwide production capacity to
cope with the expected demand.
The surface of the liberalised markets has as yet only been scratched. The
scope for growth can be measured from the fact that BAT supplied 10.3 per
cent of the total world market in 1990, but a mere 1 per cent of the
communist and former communist market, which accounted for 2,460bn
cigarettes, and only 2.9 per cent of the 1,050bn cigarettes consumed in
other countries with tobacco monopolies.
The multinationals have continued to extract profitable growth from
established markets in the US and much of western Europe in spite of a
decline in consumption under the constant and growing pressure of health
lobbies.
But they are now brimming with confidence about the outlook for profits well
beyond the next decade. In most of the newly opened markets, smoking is
still on the increase; and consumers are showing a strong preference for the
multinationals' products.
Worldwide sales of international brands, led by Philip Morris's ubiquitous
Marlboro, have grown by 7 per cent a year over the past three years, and
they are gaining market share almost everywhere from national brands in
western European countries such as France, Italy and Spain where state
monopolies have previously dominated. new markets.
The multinationals' salesmen are advancing in force into eastern Europe
where the demise of communism has opened a potential market for 700bn
cigarettes - eight times bigger than the UK's.
Economic problems, political uncertainties, and poor service facilities may
slow the profitable exploitation of opportunities. Mr Charles Pick, tobacco
industry analyst at Nomura Research Institute, says: 'The market is
characterised by a lack of hard currency, modern technology and
competition.'
Initial operations have encountered frustrating day-to-day difficulties with
inadequate banking and telephone systems, and a chronic shortage of hotel
accommodation and trained personnel. BAT's advance guard in east Germany,
for instance, lived for a time in caravans and sent messages by taxi.
The lack of clearly defined lines of responsibility between central and
local government authorities in the republics also makes negotiation long
and difficult.
But the longer-term potential is worth serious investment. Mr Philippe
Grandjean, spokesman for Philip Morris's operations in eastern Europe, says:
'We have to make a firm commitment; show that we intend to be a permanent
partner in the new systems being established in these countries. We do not
expect immediate returns. We are building a solid base for the future.'
Cigarette production in Russia this year is expected to fall about 150bn
cigarettes short of demand. Philip Morris recently signed a contract to
supply 11bn, and will start producing Marlboros in Russia this year. It
supplied the republic with 22bn cigarettes last year - and says it was paid
promptly for them in spite of reports that other companies have been offered
payment on a 720-day basis or various barter deals.
R J Reynolds, which sold 14bn cigarettes to Russia last year, also expects
to be producing Camel and other brands in a joint venture in Kazakhstan
later this year; and BAT is investigating opportunities.
In east Germany, Philip Morris has gained 44 per cent of the market by
acquiring a former state-owned factory, and simply improving the quality of
its F6 and Juwel brands as well as adding Marlboro to the range. Reynolds,
which also bought a factory, has had less success with the local Club brand
and Camel, holding only a 7 per cent share.
occupied intermediate positions by using the factories of their west German
subsidiaries to supply the new market. BAT has gained 11 per cent of the
market, but its HB and Pall Mall brands lead the higher-priced segment.
Rothmans has adopted a more cautious approach than its rivals, apparently
believing that there is scope for losing money as well as making it. But its
Golden American brand, developed to provide 'good quality at an affordable
price', has a 16 per cent share.
In Hungary, with an annual consumption of 26bn cigarettes, BAT has recently
signed a joint venture agreement with the state-owned company at Pecs, which
supplies 45 per cent of the market. It is also helping to improve the
quality of the country's tobacco crop.
Philip Morris and the Austrian state tobacco monopoly have jointly bought
another cigarette company near Budapest which has been making Marlboros
under licence for the past 15 years and has a 24 per cent market share.
Multinationals are competing to set up operations through similar deals in
Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.
While profitable sales growth may be slow in eastern Europe, Far East
markets, with rising populations and personal incomes, are already a prime
source of profits. Rothmans, for example, has 55 per cent of the Malaysian
market, and it increased operating profits in 1990 by 70 per cent.
Since US trade pressures cracked the government monopoly in Japan in the
mid-1980s, Philip Morris has captured an 11 per cent share of the 320bn
cigarette market - almost double the combined share gained by its
international rivals. Volume sales of Marlboro and other PM brands, such as
Lark, rose 22 per cent in 1990 to 35bn.
BAT, too, is well established through Lucky Strike and Kent, produced by its
US subsidiary, Brown &amp; Williamson. Its John Player Special also occupies a
profitable niche.
Rothmans, which still has less than 1 per cent of the market, is investing
in marketing its mild Dunhill Lights.
South Korea, with an annual cigarette consumption of 96bn, has proved more
difficult to penetrate. Four years after liberalisation, imports account for
only 4 per cent of the market. The national monopoly still dominates
distribution channels, and the international companies complain of red tape
and an anti-imports drive thinly disguised as a campaign against
'conspicuous consumption.'
The 40bn cigarette market in Thailand was only opened to imports late last
year; but the internationals are becoming well established in Taiwan. Philip
Morris brands lead the imports sector, but BAT's State Express 555 brand has
a 23 per cent share and sales are growing vigorously.
Rothmans is optimistic about prospects in Indonesia, where western-style
cigarettes have made little impression on a market dominated by locally
produced kreteks, a blend of cloves and tobacco.
However, the prize on which all the multinationals have set their sights is
China, where demand for cigarettes has grown by nearly 10 per cent a year
over the past decade to 1,700bn, almost a third of the world's total
consumption.
Reynolds has already established a joint venture company in the country; and
Rothmans, which has long been associated with efforts to improve Chinese
tobacco farming, is a partner in a joint venture company which will begin to
manufacture cigarettes in Shandong province in June.
Philip Morris and BAT, with its State Express, Kent and Hilton brands, have
been successful in selling into duty free and other hard currency outlets.
Imports, according to Philip Morris, still account for only 0.3 per cent of
Chinese consumption. Because of constraints on hard currency, nobody expects
any rapid growth in the near future. But the prospective rewards are worth a
little patience: just over 5 per cent of the market would equal total
cigarette sales in the UK.
