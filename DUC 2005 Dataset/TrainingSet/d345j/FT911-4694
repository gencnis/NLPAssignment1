PHILIP Morris, the huge tobacco and food combine, yesterday reported a 21.5
per cent increase in after-tax earnings in the first quarter of 1991, to
Dollars 942m.
Earnings per share rose by a similar amount, to Dollars 1.02, compared with
84 cents, although the advance in operating revenues was slightly greater,
up 24.9 per cent.
Figures for the first quarter of 1991 include results from Jacobs Suchard,
the Swiss-based coffee and confectionary group which Philip Morris bought
for Dollars 4.1bn in the autumn of 1990.
In terms of operating profits, the sharpest advance was seen in Philip
Morris' international tobacco division.
Here, profits rose to Dollars 509m from Dollars 382m, and Mr Hamish Maxwell,
the company's outgoing chairman, said unit volume - including the relatively
high-margin export business - increased by 23.4 per cent year-on-year.
On the domestic tobacco front, operating income rose by 12 per cent to
Dollars 914m, with 'slightly higher unit volume'. The US tobacco market has
been in decline for some years.
At Kraft General Foods, operating income surged by 24.5 per cent, but the
results partly reflect Suchard's inclusion. Mr Maxwell said General Foods
USA saw significant profit improvements, and KFG International also saw
higher volumes and margins in Europe.
Miller Brewing Company reported a slight improvement in operating income,
but volumes were affected by trade buy-ins ahead of the excise tax rise on
January 1.
American Brands, the tobacco, drinks and consumer products group, yesterday
reported a more modest 10.9 per cent advance in net earnings, at Dollars
216.7m, in the first quarter.
