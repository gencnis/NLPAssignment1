Philip Morris, the US cigarette, food and beer group, is to cut the
workforce at one of its main US cigarette manufacturing plants by 10 per
cent.
About 800 hourly-paid workers and 100 salaried employees will lose their
jobs at the Richmond, Virginia plant operated by Philip Morris USA, the
subsidiary responsible for domestic production of Marlboro, Benson &amp; Hedges
100s, Merit and other cigarette brands.
Earlier this week the group had warned that it planned to reduce its global
workforce by 14,000 in a restructuring aimed at defending its brands against
low-cost competitors.
The Richmond manufacturing operation, employing 9,000, looked particularly
vulnerable to lay-offs because Philip Morris has faced a severe fall in
revenues from the domestic cigarette market following the outbreak of a
price war earlier this year.
The company said world demand for for US blend cigarettes was growing, and
its share of the market was continuing to increase.
The job losses will begin in June next year.
