PHILIP MORRIS, the US food, drink and tobacco group, yesterday unveiled a
21.2 per cent rise in underlying 1991 profits, to Dollars 4.29bn.
However, large charges for an accounting change and restructuring
contributed to an overall decline, leaving net income for the period down
15.1 per cent at Dollars 3bn, or Dollars 3.25 a share.
During the 1991 fourth quarter, the group took a Dollars 1bn non-cash charge
for the accounting change and an additional Dollars 275m charge for
restructuring its worldwide food business.
As a result, net income in the fourth quarter dropped almost 13 per cent to
Dollars 767m, or 83 cents a share. Operating revenues eased 3.7 per cent in
the quarter to Dollars 13.7bn, reflecting the impact of currency
translations and a decline in revenues from the group's North American food
operations.
Stripping out the one-time items in the 1991 fourth quarter, pre-tax income
advanced 15.7 per cent while net earnings rose 21 per cent.
Philip Morris said that its real estate and North American food businesses
were the only units that did not post improved profits in the quarter.
Mr Michael Miles, who replaced Mr Hamish Maxwell as chairman last summer,
said the company's earnings and cash flow grew strongly in 1991 in spite of
the US recession.
'Although we expect consumer packaged goods companies to face extremely
competitive conditions in a weak economic environment during most of 1992,
we are well-positioned for continued earnings and cash flow growth.'
Operating profits in the domestic tobacco division rose 14.3 per cent to
Dollars 4.8bn for the year in spite of a shrinking US market, where industry
volume fell 2.4 per cent in the year. International tobacco profits rose 24
per cent to Dollars 1.7bn.
Food earnings rose 14.4 per cent to Dollars 3bn on revenues that grew 8 per
cent to Dollars 28.2bn. The comparisons are distorted by the inclusion of
Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss chocolate and coffee company, which Philip Morris
acquired in the autumn of 1990 for Dollars 4.1bn.
Most of the growth came from the group's overseas businesses. North American
food saw a 7.7 per cent improvement in operating income to Dollars 2.1bn.
Beer earnings advanced 13.3 per cent to Dollars 323m on revenues which grew
14.8 per cent to Dollars 4.1bn.
Shares in the group rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 78 1/8 at mid-day
yesterday in New York.
