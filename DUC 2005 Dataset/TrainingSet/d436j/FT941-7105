British Rail's safety procedures are strongly criticised in a report
published yesterday on the collision in the Severn rail tunnel which injured
185 passengers.
An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive says that the accident,
in December 1991, could have been avoided, even though its precise cause is
uncertain.
The report also condemns BR's implementation of its emergency plan which it
says went 'seriously wrong'. It took more than two hours for rescue services
to arrive and passengers 'all experienced an unpleasant and lengthy delay'.
In the accident, a regional Sprinter train ran into the rear of a London to
Cardiff train in the 4.4-mile Victorian tunnel under the Severn estuary.
There were 302 people on the two trains. The Sprinter's driver was seriously
injured, as were five of the passengers.
Mr Robin Seymour, chief inspecting officer of railways who conducted the
inquiry, says that after the 1988 Clapham Junction accident in London, when
35 people were killed, BR committed itself to a policy of total quality
management. 'It is disturbing to find so little evidence of its effects in
practice here,' he says.
He does not suggest railway managers and staff were negligent. But he says
that, because the tunnel had had only two minor accidents in more than a
century, 'the possibility of an emergency received too little attention
amidst other pressing priorities.
'A systematic approach to the identification, management and monitoring of
hazards, which BR has adopted in principle, could have checked all these
errors and prevented the accident.'
He concludes it was caused either by 'an unaccountable error' on the part of
the Sprinter driver, or by the signalling and telecommunications technicians
in the tunnel junction relay room. The driver, Mr Stephen Carpenter, did not
give evidence to the inquiry after legal advice.
Mr Seymour says that although the agreed plan for dealing with emergencies
was broadly satisfactory, 'the state of preparedness . . . failed to meet
the expectations of the professional emergency services'. The location of
the crash was not properly communicated at first and most of the BR rescue
team's radio pagers failed.
He makes 11 recommendations. BR said yesterday it accepted the inquiry's
findings and was overhauling the tunnel's safety at a cost of more than
Pounds 6.5m. The improvements were 'well advanced'.
