A 20-year transit veteran who operated a Boston trolley that crashed into 
another rail car had an alcohol level above the Massachusetts drunk driving 
limit, transit officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators worked into the weekend to learn the circumstances of the Boston 
accident, which injured 33 people, and a New York subway fire, which injured 
150 and claimed a second life Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Both occurred underground Friday morning.

New York Mayor David N. Dinkins said he expected city workers to have a report 
on his desk by Monday afternoon.

Authorities blamed melting slush for short-circuiting a transformer, which 
exploded and caused a smoky fire that stopped a Manhattan-bound train. 
</P>
<P>
One passenger apparently suffered a heart attack and was pronounced dead 
Friday. Another rider died early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In Boston, transit officials said the trolley's brakes and signals functioned 
properly, but the operator said he had trouble braking. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no indication that we know of at this time that alcohol was used on 
the job," said Peter Dimond, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Bay 
Transportation Authority. He said officials believe the operator drank before 
starting his shift. 
</P>
<P>
Transit officials were trying to determine whether the operator involved in the 
crash was the one a passenger had called to complain about just a half hour 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a message that there was abusive language, that the driver was not 
behaving properly, but there was no indication that there was a safety risk," 
Dimond said. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston Herald reported that a rider telephoned transit police and told a 
fare collector that a driver was cursing and had sped through a curve, knocking 
passengers from their seats.
