Crash investigators were last night trying to discover why two trains
carrying more than 150 passengers collided yesterday injuring 35 people, two
of them seriously.
The accident happened at Newton Abbot station in Devon just before 10am when
a Paignton-Cardiff train ran at low speed into the back of a stationery
InterCity train.
Some passengers were trapped in the crash and had to be freed by
firefighters, but most needed only minor treatment in hospital for
'whiplash' injuries, cuts and bruises.
Rail services were disrupted, but resumed later. British Rail said it was
looking at all possible causes of the crash including brakes, signals and
equipment. The Health and Safety Executive and the Railway Inspectorate were
examining both trains.
British Rail has been testing a computerised train safety programme,
Automatic Train Protection, which is intended to take over if a driver takes
a wrong decision or a train fails to respond to signals. Trials have been in
progress on two routes, London to Bristol and London to Aylesbury, for two
years but have been delayed by cash shortages and the complexity of the rail
network.
The cost to the taxpayer of rail privatisation is expected to reach about
Pounds 92m by the end of this month, Mr Roger Freeman, the transport
minister, said yesterday. He said the costs were small in relation to the
size of the business and the benefits of reform.
The government had made 'full financial provision' to BR and Railtrack, the
state-owned company set up to run BR's track and signalling after
privatisation, so there would be no effect on passenger services.
