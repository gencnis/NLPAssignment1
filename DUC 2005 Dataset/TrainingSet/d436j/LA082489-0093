TRAIN DERAILMENT CAUSES SHAKING LIKE EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crews finished working Wednesday to restore cars and cargo on a freight train 
that derailed Monday in Downey, tearing up about 1,100 feet of track and tying 
up street traffic at some intersections. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Pacific freight was loaded with 95 units of double-stacked 
shipping containers when it rolled off the tracks about 4:20 p.m. near Burns 
and Rives avenues. The weight and speed of the train caused a rumbling and 
rattling that shook nearby buildings much like an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the ground shook hard, railroad ties were snapped like 
toothpicks and sparks were flying as pieces of metal were torn loose. 
</P>
<P>
Small fires broke out along the tracks, but they were quickly doused by the 
Downey Fire Department, spokeswoman Sharon Crook said.

Firefighters at first believed the rail cars may have been carrying hazardous 
materials, and started to evacuate residents in a nearby apartment complex. The 
evacuation was halted about 15 minutes later, however, when the train's 
conductor assured firemen that the cargo was not hazardous. No injuries were 
reported.

The cause of the derailment was a faulty metal cross brace on one stack car, 
according to Bob Hoppe, spokesman for Southern Pacific Transportation Co. in 
Los Angeles. When the brace failed it caused downward pressure on the bottom of 
the car, pushing the wheels apart and spreading the rails. The cars behind 
simply rolled off the track. 
</P>
<P>
Hoppe said the track was expected to be repaired and reopened for service by 
early Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The train was made up of 19 articulated cars, each of which had five attached 
units holding containers stacked two high. Four cars or 20 units were derailed, 
Hoppe said. The train originated at the Long Beach Harbor intermodal container 
terminal and was bound for the East Coast.
