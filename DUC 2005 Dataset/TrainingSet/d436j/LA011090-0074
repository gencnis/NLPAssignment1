No traces of illicit drugs were found in the bodies of three victims of the 
early morning collision of an Amtrak train and a tractor-trailer rig last 
month, according to a spokesman for the San Joaquin County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's report found that the truck driver, David Haskell, died of 
"extreme blunt force trauma" and that two train crew members died of burns. 
More than 50 people suffered minor injuries in the Dec. 19 accident, which took 
place in heavy fog about five miles southeast of Stockton. Train fireman 
Michael G. Passarella, 41, of San Francisco, and engineer Edward E. McMillon, 
48, of Hayward, both died in their seats in the charred locomotive, according 
to the report.
