Two people were killed and 44 injured when two commuter trains collided head-on 
in Britain's second fatal rail crash in three days. Scotrail, a branch of the 
state-owned British Rail, said the trains were traveling at less than 30 m.p.h. 
in opposite directions when they collided outside Bellgrove Station in Glasgow. 
At least two cars of the trains, carrying about 70 passengers, derailed. The 
cause of the accident was not immediately known. A crash Saturday on the 
outskirts of London killed five people and injured 94. Last Dec. 12, three 
trains crashed near a busy south London junction during rush hour, killing 35 
people. That accident was blamed on a signal failure.
