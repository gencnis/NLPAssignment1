FT  02 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Teachers vote against test boycott

PRIMARY school teachers yesterday overwhelmingly rejected a boycott of
standard assessment tests for seven-year-olds in a ballot conducted by the
National Union of Teachers.
The result removes the threat of widespread disruption in primary schools
after a ballot was proposed at the NUT conference in Scarborough last month.
Standard assessment tasks (SATs) are already in progress in schools. Only
968 primary school teachers voted for a boycott, with 6,939 (88 per cent)
against. The response was about 65 per cent.
A separate ballot of all NUT members showed 86 per cent of those voting to
be in favour of a national campaign against testing (44,623 to 7,310).
However, only 27 per cent of NUT members voted, and the campaign is to be
limited to lobbying parents, head teachers and school governors, and will
not include industrial action.
Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, said: 'The decision not to boycott
tests this year should not be taken as indicating any weakening in our
resolve to achieve the abolition of these tests.'
Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, welcomed the ballot result, and
said: 'As I have made clear, we will look closely at the experience of
administering the tests this year to see whether they need to be made
simpler.'
The vote by the NUT, the largest teachers' union in England and Wales,
clears the way for legislation covering the government's proposed review
body for teachers' pay, currently before the House of Commons.
Mr Clarke has made establishment of the body conditional upon teaching
unions not taking strike action. None of the five other teaching unions has
expressed support for a boycott of testing.
