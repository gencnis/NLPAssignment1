Standards in a quarter of mathematics lessons in England and Wales are
unsatisfactory, says a report published yesterday by Ofsted, the education
watchdog, John Authers writes.
But this represents an improvement on last year, when a third of lessons
were unsatisfactory, says the report, the fourth annual survey of teaching
standards in the core national curriculum subjects of English, mathematics
and science.
The report says that the last three years of primary school are a period of
weakness for all three subjects. Teachers need more in-service training, it
says, both for their use of assessment and recording, and to acquire more
knowledge about the mathematical content of the curriculum.
In English 88 per cent of lessons for seven-year-olds were satisfactory, up
from 80 per cent last year. But in secondary schools 'good diagnosis of the
needs of poor readers were rare'.
The report also found that standards in English were not maintained in the
last three years at primary school, with 40 per cent of lessons not keeping
up the good start.
The report was positive on science, saying that the curriculum had secured
'a broad and balanced provision of science education for all pupils'.
