Italy's population has scarcely grown over the past decade and is shifting
from large city centres to smaller cities and large towns, according to
preliminary results of the 10-yearly national census, published yesterday,
writes Robert Graham in Rome. The population grew by just 0.3 per cent to
56,411,290, compared with a 3.9 per cent increase in the previous decade,
confirming Italy's declining birthrate, one of the lowest in Europe.
