FALLING EUROPEAN BIRTH RATE IS NEW PROBLEM FOR NATO

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is facing a manpower shortage because of 
falling birth rates in its 16 member nations. 
</P>
<P>
One remedy, officials here at NATO headquarters say, is the talks with the 
Soviet-led East Bloc in Vienna, which could bring an accord on reducing troops 
and conventional arms in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Institute for Defense Analysis has forecast that by the year 2000, 
NATO members will see an average 12.4% drop in draft-age males while there will 
be a 15.2% increase among the seven Warsaw Pact nations. 
</P>
<P>
One reason is what the West Germans call the pillenknick (pill dip), a falling 
birth rate due to greater use of the birth control pill in recent decades. 
</P>
<P>
According to statistics supplied by the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers, 
Europe, the problem is most acute in West Germany, whose supply of draft-age 
males will decline 45% from 1985 to 2000. 
</P>
<P>
In that same period, the statistics indicated, the Netherlands will see a drop 
in males in the 18-to-24 age group of 30%, followed by Belgium, 27%; Britain 
and Luxembourg, 25% each; Italy, 23%; Denmark, 17%; France, 13%, and Portugal, 
9%. 
</P>
<P>
Greece's supply of draftable males will remain even over the next decade. Only 
Turkey expects an increase. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. armed forces also face a declining manpower base. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, 2.2 million Americans were old enough to sign up for military service. 
This fell to 1.9 million last year and will dip to 1.6 million by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
To maintain adequate defenses, NATO is considering improving the combat role of 
reserve forces, possibly by amending the way they are deployed in times of 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"The need to tap this potential has taken on a new urgency," said Gen. John 
Akehurst, the deputy supreme allied commander in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In wartime, under present plans NATO forces would include 5 million people, 
half of them reserves or volunteer citizen-soldiers whose key wartime task 
would be to provide logistical support for combat troops. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has begun strengthening its military reserves. Since 1980, 
their numbers have increased from 1.4 million to 1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany also has begun doubling the number of reservists for military 
excercises, but with mixed results: in 1985, a third of its reservists never 
showed up for their service. 
</P>
<P>
Reservists do not enjoy equal prestige in all allied nations, and there are a 
variety of rules regarding their function. 
</P>
<P>
"The education and training periods are different, the time a country is really 
going to use its reservists, i.e. keep them trained and keep them on the list 
for active duty, is different," one NATO official said. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result, there is a large pool of reserves . . . not trained to the extent 
required." 
</P>
<P>
The increased use of reserves would offset the effect of falling birth rates, 
but the "graying" of NATO populations also will reduce the ranks of reserves. 
</P>
<P>
This is already evident in West Germany, which has 1.6 million reservists but 
will have only 1 million by the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Finding enough manpower poses special problems for the volunteer armed forces 
of Britain, the United States and Canada, which compete with private industry 
for a shrinking pool of personnel.
