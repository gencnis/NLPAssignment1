There are just too few babies in Japan. Seiroku Kajiyama, secretary-general
of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, says so. And furthermore that is the
prime reason for the faltering competitiveness of the country.
One of a family of 10, Kajiyama told a seminar of female LDP supporters that
large families foster a competitive spirit. 'You don't need to have as many
as 10, three to five would do,' he said, explaining that the stampede for
food at the dinner table encourages the survival instinct.
Some senior LDP officials seem to be obsessed with the fact that women are
choosing to have longer careers and fewer children, leaving Japan with a
birth rate of 9.8 per 1,000 last year, the lowest recorded. The figure
prompted Kajiyama to compare modern Japan to failed socialist societies,
which he thinks lacked the fierce entrepreneurial spirit that big families
inspire.
Kajiyama's homespun theory is a contribution to the debate over the rise of
the shinjinrui, the 'new type of people' - those who, unlike their
forebears, are willing to take holidays, swap jobs and generally enjoy
themselves. The very people, indeed, who would have the time to produce the
babies he is so keen to see.
