The sprawling, air-conditioned hotel at the edge of the Amazon forest teemed 
with ideas for saving the world's biggest tropical wilderness. It was a 
flourishing ecosystem of ideas, with the exuberance of a triple-canopy jungle, 
some ideas like towering trees, others like dense undergrowth and entwining 
vines. 
</P>
<P>
They sprouted from the mouths of conservationists, researchers, government 
technicians and officials; they blossomed from photocopied treatises, slide 
projectors and posters; they germinated on note pads and paper napkins. The 
lush proliferation of ideas left no doubt that an international conference 
called "Forest 90" was a fertile theoretical environment. 
</P>
<P>
A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
Dirigibles will float over the wilderness, lowering in loggers to cut mature 
hardwood trees with as little damage to the forest as possible. New trees will 
be planted to replace the harvested ones, which will be hoisted into the sky 
and carried to nearby rivers, then floated to distant sawmills. No more logging 
roads slicing destructively through the fragile flora and fauna. 
</P>
<P>
Forest dwellers will not only tap rubber and gather Brazil nuts, as they do 
today, but also will collect foods, medicinal plants, gums, fibers, dyes, oils 
and other products for marketing in Brazil and abroad. Useful species will be 
reseeded. In riverside settlements, processing plants and cottage industries 
will turn forest products into finished goods, providing needed jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural extension workers will help farmers cultivate combinations of 
trees that yield profitable crops on small plots, protecting the land from the 
erosion and hardening that can occur when the forest is removed. This sustained 
"agroforestry" will render unnecessary the slash-and-burn farming methods that 
have already destroyed so much native forest. 
</P>
<P>
Landowners will raise big, fast-growing Amazon fish in ponds covering a few 
acres, earning much more than they could by raising cattle on large tracts of 
cleared land. Waste from chicken coops at the edge of the water will feed the 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
Two million Amazon colonos, pioneer farmers from other parts of Brazil, have 
shown how the imperative of economic survival can devour virgin forest. Most 
colonos begin by planting traditional subsistence crops such as beans, corn and 
an abundant root crop called manioc on cleared forest land. When the soil wears 
out in two or three years, they clear more land. More rain forest disappears. 
</P>
<P>
Saving the forest, it was clear here, is not only a matter of curbing rapacious 
ranchers, but also of offering small farmers economic alternatives to 
destructive methods. 
</P>
<P>
Like the vast rain forest itself, the ideas for weaning farmers from the 
slash-and-burn cycle seemed to have no end. 
</P>
<P>
Plant manioc in combination with nitrogen-fixing legumes that will replenish 
and protect weak soils. Exploit unwooded river flood plains with intensive 
cultivation of rice or super-grasses to feed livestock. Grow shade-seeking 
perennial crops, such as pepper and cacao, under otherwise useless secondary 
forest growth, capoeira, on the deforested land. Develop more productive 
agroforestry "consortiums" of different crop trees that thrive together. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to "fix the man on the land" with a sustainable system of 
production. "For every year this person doesn't have to move, it means 'X' 
number of acres that aren't cleared," said John Butler, a consultant with the 
World Wildlife Fund. 
</P>
<P>
But Forest 90's 1,200 participants -- environmentalists and government 
officials -- well knew that as deforestation chews away at Brazil's Amazon 
region, ideas alone will not save the unmatched diversity of its myriad plants 
and animals. 
</P>
<P>
While the impressive flood of ideas offered hope for the Amazon, it also 
underlined a difficult challenge: A monumental effort is needed to sort out the 
various forest-saving possibilities and to put them into widespread practice. 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish the goal, new techniques must be taught, and other assistance 
delivered, to a rural population of 5 million in an area nearly three times as 
large as Alaska. That could require an army of agricultural extension agents. 
Currently, few results of Amazon agricultural research reach farmers in the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Luiz Carlos Molion, a Brazilian climatologist and forest hydrologist, served 
himself a few chunks of river fish from the hotel's luncheon buffet. 
</P>
<P>
"This is tambaqui, but it's undersized," said Molion, 43, a stout man with a 
ruddy face and scraggly russet beard. "They're taking small fish from the 
rivers because the big ones are being fished out." 
</P>
<P>
Demand for tambaqui and other Amazon fish is high: A kilogram of tambaqui costs 
more than a kilogram of beef in Manaus, a city of more than a million people. 
Molion and others who know the Amazon say fish-raising in ponds could become a 
major source of food and income for the region's people, with a low ecological 
cost. But so far, little has been done to implement the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Leonir Naumann is an exception rather than the rule. He operates a farm near 
the village of Bela Vista, 40 miles west of Manaus on the Upper Amazon River. 
And on his farm he has a fishpond, full of maturing tambaqui, tucunare and 
pirarucu. 
</P>
<P>
Naumann, 33, walked along the shore and pointed to fish breaking the pond's 
surface. He said he soon will take his first catch to market and his farm will 
begin to turn a profit for the first time in the 10 years he has owned it. He 
also has 135 head of dairy cattle, but he said poor Amazon soil makes pasture 
maintenance too expensive to be profitable. 
</P>
<P>
He wore sandals and blue shorts, and his tanned shoulders shone like copper 
under the midday sun as he stopped to make a simple calculation: Each cow 
requires 2.5 acres of grazing land, but 2.5 acres of fishpond will produce more 
than 150,000 pounds of tambaqui in three years. He feeds the fish dried cow 
manure and manioc -- a crop he also fertilizes with manure. 
</P>
<P>
About 740 acres of forest has been cleared from Naumann's 4,300 acres of land, 
and he said he will cut no more. "I am against deforestation," he said. "There 
is a lot of deforested land and it isn't being used." 
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 square miles of Brazil's Amazon forest has been razed for 
pasture, an area larger than Oregon. An estimated two-thirds of that has 
degenerated into brush and the secondary forest growth, capoeira. 
</P>
<P>
Agroforestry has proved to be one of the most productive uses of cleared Amazon 
land. Over the years, Sebastiao Silva Martins, 65, has planted a small jungle 
on his plot outside Bela Vista. His trees produce rubber, cacao, oranges, 
passion fruit, mangoes, palm peaches and cupuacu. Some thrive in the shade; 
others grow high, seeking sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
The trees protect the fragile soil from hardening and erosion. They produce 
year after year. The tree farm doesn't require much work, and Martins doesn't 
have to spend money on such things as fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
"The fertilizer is just the leaves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Naumann, Martins gets no help from agricultural extension workers or 
ecologists. He has learned which combinations of trees work best from talking 
with his neighbors and experimenting. In his small way, he has demonstrated 
that farming in the Amazon need not destroy the forest. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest controversy at the conference was about "extractive reserves" -- 
forest areas set aside for residents to exploit without destroying them. The 
government has created four extractive reserves with a total of 5.4 million 
acres and others are being planned. But debate goes on over whether they will 
be economically sustainable in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
Critics said prices for forest products such as natural latex, nuts and herbs 
cannot adequately compensate for the time it takes to gather them. They 
contended that when demand increases for a forest product, it will be depleted 
-- or domesticated for more economical production on farms. 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of the concept argued that markets for new products must be 
developed. They predicted that the forest's hundreds of thousands of plant 
species, many of them yet to be studied, will be a cornucopia of marketable new 
material. And they said forest areas can be "enriched" by planting. 
</P>
<P>
Americans interested in rain-forest conservation already have begun buying ice 
cream and other products made with Amazon ingredients. Some conference 
participants envisioned a boom in demand for "rain-forest chic" products. 
</P>
<P>
"Either we find ways to preserve the forest and improve the lives of the people 
there, or 20 or 30 years from now there won't be any more researchers 
researching the forest, because there won't be any forest," said Julio Barbosa, 
a rubber-tappers union leader. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and government officials at Forest 90 agreed that the Amazon 
should be zoned for forest preservation and controlled development. Jose 
Goldemberg, the national secretary of science and technology, said a regional 
zoning plan is being prepared and will be finished by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Alcir Meira, superintendent of the official Amazon development agency, said the 
agency is drafting its sixth plan for the region. The agency, known by the 
acronym SUDAM, dedicated much of its efforts in the past to fostering big 
cattle ranching projects in the Amazon, granting tax concessions and other 
incentives. But Meira said the new plan will emphasize ecological balance. 
</P>
<P>
"What it will not permit anymore is to give incentives for cutting down forest 
for ranching," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Molion, the forest hydrologist, is creating a new Amazon agency called Unitrop 
that will distribute donated funds for research on ecologically compatible 
development and for extension work. He said one of the first projects to be 
sponsored by Unitrop will distribute minnows and teach farmers to operate 
commercial fishponds. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't need to cut the forest to plant and harvest it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That, in essence, is the gospel according to Forest 90. The future of the 
Amazon may rest largely on whether its message is heard.
