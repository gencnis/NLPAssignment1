DOG TRIGGERS BOMB SCARE AT AIR STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Miramar Naval Air Station entrance was closed and nearby homes were evacuated 
for more than an hour Tuesday when a military police dog signaled its handler 
that a civilian car contained explosives, a Navy spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing that the dog had a 100% reliability rate for substance detection and 
that the dog's signal is considered unusual, explosive-disposal experts were 
brought in from North Island about 12:45 p.m. to search the car, Chief Petty 
Officer Bobbie Carleton said. 
</P>
<P>
Navy personnel closed Miramar's north entrance and evacuated eight duplexes 
housing military families during the 80-minute search, which revealed no 
explosive material. 
</P>
<P>
"The sensitivity of these type of detection dogs is very high, so residue from 
an explosive substance on the seat of the car, for example, would have caused 
that dog to alert," Carleton said. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year-old German shepherd was stationed at the gate as part of a 
periodically conducted random search for drugs, contraband, explosives and 
stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
The car, which belongs to a woman visiting the base, had recently been stolen 
and recovered, Carleton said.
