FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Europe Today - Frontier-free
Europe to work harder
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Drug-sniffing dogs at Dover and other international borders will have to
work harder in a frontier-free Europe as illegal traders look for a boom in
single market crime. Security officials say there will be no let-up in the
fight against drug smugglers. They will also be watching for the illegal
movement of explosives, high technology goods of military potential,
pornography, artworks, and endangered species. Border law-enforcers carrying
out spot checks on vehicles and people are now mobile, and - if governments
can agree on a headquarters for Europol organisation - police co-operation
on terrorism and drugs should improve.
