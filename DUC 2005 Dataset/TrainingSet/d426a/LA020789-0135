</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Orange County Police Canine Assn. has offered a $500 reward for the return 
of a German shepherd that ran away from the Santa Ana police canine unit Monday 
after strong winds blew open a wooden gate at its handler's Westminster home. 
</P>
<P>
Vasko, a 5-year-old, male German shepherd, disappeared from the home of Officer 
Mike Fleet, near Springdale Drive and the San Diego Freeway, between midnight 
and 5 a.m., Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Fleet's family dog, a 6-month-old, black and white Alaskan malamute named 
Nakita, also ran away. Vasko, described as "very friendly," has an 
identification number, GH2999, tattooed inside his right ear. 
</P>
<P>
Vasko is used primarily in crime scene searches and searches for narcotics and 
missing persons, Thomas said. The dog also is used in demonstrations at Orange 
County schools. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said Vasko obeys commands in both German and English and does not have a 
collar.
