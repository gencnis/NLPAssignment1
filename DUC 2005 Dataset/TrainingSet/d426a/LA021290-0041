Six convicts, including three murderers, escaped from the maximum-security 
Joliet Correctional Center early Sunday, apparently by cutting through metal 
bars, state police said. One was captured later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
The escapees, most in their 20s and all in segregation cells as disciplinary 
problems, were considered extremely dangerous, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Munoz was captured shortly after 5:30 p.m. at a cousin's Chicago home by 
officers who had staked it out, state Department of Corrections spokesman Nic 
Howell said. Munoz, 22, was serving a sentence for narcotics violations and 
intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
A search with dogs and an airplane was called off because the escapees 
apparently split up, state police trooper Thomas Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The prisoners escaped from the segregation cells, authorities said. Four of the 
inmates were doubled up in cells and the other two were in cells alone. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of when the prisoners escaped changed over the course of the day. State 
police originally reported the men were discovered missing at 4:55 a.m., but 
Howell said later that the discovery was made after a 7 a.m. inmate count came 
up short. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 corrections officers specially trained to deal with escapes assisted 
state police and local law enforcement officers in the search. 
</P>
<P>
The inmates had to cut through bars on the cells, break a window, cut through 
bars outside the window and cross a fence to get away, Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, this is a breach of security," he said. "They shouldn't have had 
the materials to be able to cut with and should not have been able to cut like 
this without being noticed." 
</P>
<P>
The prison, which has been plagued by overcrowding in recent years, is one of 
the state's four maximum-security facilities and one of two in Joliet.
