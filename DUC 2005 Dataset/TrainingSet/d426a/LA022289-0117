Santa Ana Police Officer Judy Stanbra hasn't talked to her partner in 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Yet they went to school together. They walk the beat together. They even live 
together. 
</P>
<P>
But even though they aren't great conversationalists, Stanbra says, she and her 
partner get along quite well. 
</P>
<P>
Stanbra's partner is a dog -- Sammy, a 4-year-old Belgian malinois. 
</P>
<P>
"He's my partner during the day, but he becomes a pet at home," said Stanbra, 
an animal lover who, besides Sammy, lives with two civilian dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Stanbra, 31, is a 7 1/2-year police veteran. She has long had an interest in 
veterinary medicine and said she applied for the canine unit because she enjoys 
"being outside and working with animals." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons we picked her is because she had a special feeling working 
with animals," said Sgt. Raul Luna, head of Santa Ana Police Department's 
six-member canine unit. "She was excellent in training." 
</P>
<P>
Five of the department's dogs are Belgian malinois imported from the 
Netherlands, where they are trained by Dutch police before being sent to Santa 
Ana. (The sixth canine is a German shepherd.) 
</P>
<P>
The police officer and the dog then train together for 5 weeks before they 
begin patrolling the streets. Besides working together, they live together. 
</P>
<P>
The canine unit, which was started in February, 1982, is used primarily to 
assist in looking for suspects in buildings or other areas and in SWAT 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
"They're able to use their noses and give us a better chance of finding 
suspects," Stanbra said. 
</P>
<P>
"Dogs can also do the . . . (search) faster," Luna said.
