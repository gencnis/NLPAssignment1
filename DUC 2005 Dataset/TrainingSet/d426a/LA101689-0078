Four Newport Beach public safety officers have been selected to receive 
employee-of-the-year awards, one of the highest honors their departments can 
bestow for outstanding public service. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach Police Department has named Thomas Voth, 36, of Orange as 
Officer of the Year for 1989. Voth, a 12-year police veteran, is one of three 
officers on the force who work with police dogs. 
</P>
<P>
He and his partner, a 5-year-old German shepherd named Hondo, are credited with 
field work and searches that have resulted in several arrests. Department 
officials also praised Voth for his work with Neighborhood Watch organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Voth was selected for consistent and outstanding teamwork," Sgt. Andy Gonis 
said. "He is always there when you need him, and he always does a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Named Firefighter of the Year was Richard D. Middlebrough, 42, of Laguna 
Niguel. Middlebrough, a 14-year veteran, is part of the department's videotape 
unit at its headquarters and president of the Newport Beach Firefighters Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have fun doing my job, and that's about it," Middlebrough said. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguard of the Year honors went to Mike Halphide, 24, of Yorba Linda, a 
recent graduate of UC Irvine. Halphide, who has been a seasonal lifeguard since 
1984, is credited with hundreds of rescues. 
</P>
<P>
"He is an all-round great guy and has done every job that's been handed to 
him," Marine Safety Officer Mitchell White said. "He's one of the leaders down 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Brian Kleeman, 46, of Huntington Beach has been 
named Harbor Patrolman of the Year for his contributions to training exercises 
involving marine firefighting. 
</P>
<P>
Kleeman, a 17-year veteran of the Sheriff's Department, was praised 
particularly for a joint exercise with the Newport Beach Fire Department to 
assess firefighting capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Voth, Middlebrough, Halphide, and Kleeman were honored Saturday night at a 
dinner-dance hosted by the Newport Harbor American Legion. DAN WEIKEL
