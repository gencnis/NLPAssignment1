POLICE DOG STOPS SUSPECT IN CAR THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 27-year-old El Cajon transient was arrested Friday in Lakeside after leading 
police on a chase that ended shortly after he rammed a Sheriff's Department 
canine unit car, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
The chase started Friday evening in El Cajon when police saw Christopher 
Rossmiller in a car that had been reported stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Officers radioed for assistance from the Sheriff's Department, said Sgt. Roy 
Stamper of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Police pursued Rossmiller through Lakeside, traveling north on Highway 67 until 
they reached a dirt lot by East Pino Road. The car driven by Rossmiller 
stalled. When he restarted it, he rammed the car carrying the police dog Sarge 
and continued out toward Lake Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
The damaged Sheriff's Department car remained in the chase. When Rossmiller 
reached Flynn Springs Road off Interstate 8, he jumped from his car and began 
running through a mobile-home park. The German shepherd leaped after Rossmiller 
and stopped him by fastening onto his groin, Stamper said.
