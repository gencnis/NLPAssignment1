<P>
The City Council has approved legislation to protect the health and safety of 
more than 12,000 city workers who use video display terminals. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is the toughest VDT law in the nation and the first law of its kind in 
a major city, according to the New York City Video Display Terminal Coalition 
of labor unions and occupational safety and health groups. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved Tuesday, mandates that VDT operators at city agencies be 
given a 15-minute break whenever they are required to work at a terminal for 
more than two consecutive hours. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, VDT workers with certain medical conditions -- including 
pregnancy -- would be allowed to obtain transfers. Some studies have suggested 
prolonged VDT exposure increases risk of miscarriage.
