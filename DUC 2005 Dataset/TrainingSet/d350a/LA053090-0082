EC Adopts VDT Safety Regulations: The 12-nation European Community adopted 
sweeping safety regulations for workers who use video display terminals, 
including periodic breaks and the right to regular eye examinations. The rules 
also call for glare-free and swiveling screens, "adequate spacing" between 
characters and lines, and adjustable seats with a footrest if requested. VDTs 
put into service after Dec. 31, 1992, must meet the new regulations, and 
existing equipment must be modified by the end of 1996.
