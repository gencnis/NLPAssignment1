FT  04 NOV 93 / RSI regulations 'being ignored'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO-THIRDS of employers are not conforming with new European Community
health and safety regulations on display screens, according to a survey by
the MSF technical union.
The union said that many people could be at risk from repetitive strain
injury, stress and eyesight problems as a result.
The poll of 240 union safety officers found that 50 per cent of employers
had failed to carry out the legal requirement to assess risks to health
associated with screens.
