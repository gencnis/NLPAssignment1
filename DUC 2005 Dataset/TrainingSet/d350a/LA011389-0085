A law requiring rest breaks and special training for many workers using video 
display terminals went into effect in a Long Island, N.Y., county despite a 
legal challenge. Suffolk County health officials, who will enforce the law, 
estimated that it applies to 8,500 VDT users in 150 to 200 businesses. The 
measure is believed to be the first VDT-regulating law enacted by a local 
government. A state Supreme Court judge is expected to rule within the next two 
weeks on a challenge to the measure brought by four businesses.
