criticised

HEALTH and safety rules covering an estimated 7m workers who use visual
display units (VDUs) launched yesterday immediately came under attack from
trade unions and environmental health officers.
Unions claimed that the new rules provided too many loopholes for employers
and failed to meet the requirements of a European Community directive.
At the same time, the Institution of Environmental Health Officers warned
that the new regulations might lead to safety inspectors spending too much
time visiting offices and neglecting more dangerous premises.
The new rules, which are published in a consultation document by the Health
and Safety Executive, cover the design of desks and chairs, as well as the
provision of work breaks and eye tests for workers who use VDUs.
The TUC warned that the proposed regulations would not meet EC standards. Mr
Alan Tuffin, general secretary of the UCW postal workers' union and chairman
of the TUC's health and safety committee, said the TUC would be lobbying
unions throughout the EC on the issue.
Mr Tuffin is also a commissioner on the Health and Safety Commission.
Unions claim that thousands of VDU workers will be excluded from the
regulations because the definition of a regular user has been too narrowly
defined. They also say that the proposals would not entitle all VDU workers
to a full eye test.
The Institution of Environmental Health Officers said it was concerned that
office workers would become anxious as a result of the new rules. That would
mean greater pressure on environmental health officers to respond to queries
and complaints, taking away resources from high-risk premises.
