FT  28 JUL 94 / Outdated resorts 'hitting tourism'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Outdated resorts are damaging the reputation of more attractive English
tourist attractions, making it difficult to persuade UK residents to take
their holidays at home, the English Tourist Board said yesterday.
The board said that over the past decade the UK's tourism balance of
payments had fallen from breakeven to a deficit of Pounds 3.1bn. The deficit
had grown in spite of the increase in foreign visitors to the UK.
