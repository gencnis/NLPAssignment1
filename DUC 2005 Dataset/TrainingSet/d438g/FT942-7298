The Confederation of British Industry yesterday moved tourism closer to the
top of its agenda, admitting that it had paid insufficient attention to the
industry in the past.
In its first response to this week's white paper on competitiveness, the CBI
said it was setting up a Tourism Action Group to raise the industry's
profile. The paper said UK tourism was losing market share. The CBI also
published a report on tourism, saying the industry had the potential to
create many jobs.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said tourism employment grew by 31
per cent between 1983 and last year, well above the rate for the economy as
a whole. He said tourism was one of the country's leading industries, with
annual revenues of Pounds 29.6bn, accounting for 5.6 per cent of gross
domestic product, and earning Pounds 10bn in foreign exchange a year. It
employed more than 1.4m people - 6 per cent of UK employment.
Mr Davies said the tourist industry worldwide was expected to double in size
by the year 2005. Although the UK was the world's sixth-biggest earner of
tourist receipts, its US dollar market share had fallen from 6.8 per cent in
1980 to 4.2 per cent today.
British tourism faced increased competition, he said. However, he added that
the UK had a good reputation in tourist markets such as the US and,
increasingly, in western Europe and Japan.
The new CBI group will urge greater support from the government in areas
such as tax and public transport. It will also encourage better training.
