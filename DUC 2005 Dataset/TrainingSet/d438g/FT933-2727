A RECORD 18.5m tourists visited Britain in the 12 months to March, 8 per
cent more than the previous year - and the British Tourist Authority said
yesterday that it was expecting even higher numbers this year.
The authority's forecast for this year, contained in its annual report, is
based on figures for the January-to-June period when there were 8.5m
visitors, up 10 per cent on the same period last year.
Launching the report, Ms Adele Biss, who chairs the authority, said: 'We are
forecasting an even stronger year to come as we reap the benefits of
devaluation and the move away from simple sun-bathing to the more fulfilling
holidays that Britain offers.'
Spending by tourists in the year to the end of March grew less dramatically,
increasing by only 7 per cent to Pounds 7.9bn. Tourists have bought cheaper
holidays, cut short their length of stay and taken advantage of heavy
discounting by the tourist industry.
Travel from North America was up 18 per cent last year on 1991 - but tourism
from the US that year was hit badly by the Gulf war. The number of Americans
has still not recovered to 1990 levels.
Sir John Egan, chief executive of BAA, the airports operator, is to become
chairman of the London Tourist Board.
