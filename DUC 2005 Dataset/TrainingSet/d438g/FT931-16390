</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRIPS to the UK by overseas visitors totalled 15.4m for the first 10 months
of 1992, a rise of 8 per cent on the same period in 1991, the British
Tourist Authority said yesterday.
The number of visits from western Europe was the highest ever for the first
10 months of a year in 1992, at 9.66m, with figures for the last few weeks
of the period helped by sterling devaluation.
