<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of foreign visitors to the UK rose 8 per cent to 12m in the first
eight months of the year, and their spending rose 8 per cent to Pounds
5.01bn, according to the International Passenger Survey.
A record 2.3m people visited in August - a 4 per cent rise on August last
year, and their spending rose 2 per cent to Pounds 995m. The British Tourist
Authority predicted that tourist numbers would grow because of the fall in
sterling.
