FT  15 JUL 93 / Business optimism rising in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH business optimism is higher than at any time since late 1990,
according to yesterday's quarterly survey published by the Fraser of
Allander Institute and six chambers of commerce.
The institute - the economic research body at Strathclyde University in
Glasgow - found business confidence had risen across the board, even in the
construction industry. It also found rising demand for personal loans.
Demand had risen 'significantly' in manufacturing and retailing, but had
fallen in construction. A 'moderate' rise in the wholesale and tourism
sectors was noted in the survey.
Investment plans were stepped up in manufacturing, distribution and tourism,
but had been reduced in the construction and oil industries.
The survey also found that while jobs continued to be shed in all sectors -
apart from tourism and leisure - the rate of decline was slowing down.
Pay rises, however, continued to fall in construction and the wholesale,
retail and finance sectors, but rose in the manufacturing and tourism
industries.
In all sectors except manufacturing pay rises stood at 4 per cent or less.
