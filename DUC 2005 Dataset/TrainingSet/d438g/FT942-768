Taxis, tourism and turnips have been among the beneficiaries of changes in
consumer spending since the mid 1980s while tea and tabloids have lost out,
Philip Coggan writes.
Figures released by the Central Statistical Office yesterday show that UK
consumers spent Pounds 405.87bn in 1993, or around Pounds 7,000 per head.
Spending on vegetables rose by a third between 1986 and 1993 but Britons
still spend more on confectionery than they do on their greens.
Britons are venturing farther afield. Spending on overseas tourism increased
by 40 per cent between 1986 and 1993, while the money spent by foreign
tourists in Britain rose by less than 5 per cent. For domestic travel, the
attractions of a door-to-door service helped increase spending on taxis by a
third, while that on bus fares fell by over a tenth.
Spending on newspapers is down - a 7 per cent fall between 1986 and 1993 -
but spending on magazines is up.
