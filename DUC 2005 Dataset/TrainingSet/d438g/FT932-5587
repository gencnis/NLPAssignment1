THE UK TOURIST industry this year enjoyed its best-ever first quarter, with
3.6m visitors entering the country, figures released yesterday by the
British Tourist Authority show, Michael Skapinker writes.
Tourist spending was also at record levels, up 13 per cent to Pounds 1.5bn.
Visitor numbers were 8 per cent up from last year.
The increases were achieved in spite of a fall in the number of North
American visitors. Visits by North Americans fell 6 per cent to 600,000 in
the first quarter. However, the number of visitors from western Europe rose
12 per cent to 2.3m - higher than in any previous first quarter.
