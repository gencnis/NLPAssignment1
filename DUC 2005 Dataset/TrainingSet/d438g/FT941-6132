FT  03 MAR 94 / Tourism spending reaches Pounds 9.1bn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Spending by overseas visitors to the UK rose 15 per cent to a record Pounds
9.1bn last year, but higher expenditure by British travellers abroad led to
a widening of the tourism balance-of-payments deficit.
British travellers abroad spent Pounds 12.8bn last year, a 14 per cent
increase on 1992, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday.
The travel account deficit of the balance of payments rose to Pounds 3.7bn,
compared with Pounds 3.4bn in 1992.
