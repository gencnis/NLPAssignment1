Help is at hand for many thousands of disabled people who are unable to feed
themselves, writes Andrew Baxter.
Handy 1, designed by Mike Topping, development manager at the University of
Keele's rehabilitation robotics project, enables severely disabled people to
eat unaided.
The product, a robotic arm with contoured spoon attached to an electronic
control unit on an adjustable stand, allows users to eat at their own pace.
A stalk switch mounted on a flexible gooseneck can be operated by hand or
head movements, giving the user control.
Earlier this month, Handy 1 won the Pounds 7,000 Institution of Electrical
Engineers Prize for Helping Disabled People. University of Keele, Case Unit:
UK, 0782 712774.
