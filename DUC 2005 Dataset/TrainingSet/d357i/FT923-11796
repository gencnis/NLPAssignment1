THE SIX members of the Association of South East Nations yesterday sought to
ease tensions over the disputed Spratly islands in the South China Sea by
urging the countries involved to exercise restraint.
In a special declaration at the end of a two-day meeting in Manila, the
foreign ministers of Asean - grouping Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - emphasised the need to resolve
arguments over sovereignty and jurisdiction 'by peaceful means, without
resort to force'.
They suggested the establishment of 'a code of international conduct over
the South China Sea' to be based on the principles of their regional Treaty
of Amity and Co-operation, and resolved to explore the possibility of
collaborating on maritime navigation, pollution control and anti-piracy
operations in the area.
The dispute over the Spratlys came to a head earlier this year when China
reaffirmed its claim to the entire archipelago and granted an oil
exploration licence to a US company in a zone also claimed by Vietnam.
Asked whether Asean regarded China as a bully, Mr Raul Manglapus, foreign
minister of the Philippines, replied: 'We have said China has its own
historical claims which we might reject in the light of 20th century
realities, but we have never said it's a bully.'
A decision to set aside the issue of sovereignty over the Spratlys did not
mean that the countries concerned could not peacefully continue or even
reinforce their presence on the islands, he said.
For the first time since it was founded 25 years ago in the shadow of the
spread of communism in Indochina, Asean explicitly put the emphasis on
security concerns.
In another sign of the changing international climate, Vietnam and Laos were
yesterday granted observer status at future Asean meetings.
