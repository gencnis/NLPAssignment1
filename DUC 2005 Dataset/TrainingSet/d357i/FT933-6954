CHINA and Vietnam yesterday sought to open a new chapter in their vexed
relations, with their first high-level talks on long-running territorial
disputes, including a row over oil drilling rights in the Tonkin Gulf.
Mr Tang Jiaxuan, China's vice foreign minister, talked of a 'new situation'
in relations between the once close allies, and said that Beijing would
'participate in the negotiations with positive, practical and constructive
attitudes'.
Western officials in Beijing say that while it was important that the
neighbours should have resumed discussions in an apparently cordial
atmosphere, significant barriers remained to an early resolution of disputes
over territory both in the Tonkin Gulf, and in the South China Sea where the
two sides are locked in disagreement over ownership of the Spratly Islands.
Mr Vu Khoan, Vietnam's vice foreign minister, said at a welcoming ceremony
at China's state guest house that the two sides had come together to 'help
resolve various problems left over from history'.
Agreement on this new round of talks was reached during a visit to Hanoi
last December by China's Premier Li Peng. That visit was aimed at
establishing a new basis of trust and understanding after the mutual
antagonism of the recent past.
China, angered by Hanoi's invasion of Cambodia, launched a brief border war
against Vietnam in 1979 which it described at the time as a 'counter attack
in self defence'.
Chinese forces received a 'bloody nose' at the hands of the Vietnamese.
It was not until 1991 that relations were normalised again, but lingering
mistrust delayed the resumption of serious efforts to resolve their
differences.
