Britain and Argentina are to hold talks in July on joint oil exploration in
waters surrounding the Falkland Islands, two years after a previous round of
oil talks collapsed.
A British official said negotiators would focus on the next phase of
exploration. The Falklands' government plans a second licensing round for
seismic explorations beginning in July and running until March 1995.
The Falklands selected two companies to carry out initial seismic surveys
shortly after the 1992 negotiations failed. Argentina broke off talks after
failing to agree on demarcation of Falkland waters bordering its territorial
waters.
International oil companies say co-operation with Argentina is important,
given the need for heavy investments in a disputed zone.
A UK official said successful joint management of fish stocks showed the
sovereignty dispute could be put aside while both sides pursued practical
interests, but Argentina's foreign ministry argues oil is different because
it is a non-renewable resource, with important legal and tax ramifications.
Both sides fear concessions over oil would imply recognition of the other's
sovereignty claim.
The Falklands remain a fixation in Argentina, which still claims the
islands, despite defeat in the 1982 conflict with Britain. President Carlos
Menem says Argentina will 'recover' the islands by the year 2000.
Argentine security forces have raided a secret training camp in thick forest
close to Buenos Aires used by paramilitaries linked to right-wing army
rebels who have led four mutinies since 1987.
