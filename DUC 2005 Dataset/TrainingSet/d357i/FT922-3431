AN international court of arbitration yesterday ended a 25-year-old dispute
between France and Canada over territorial waters claimed by the tiny French
Atlantic Ocean islands of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, Reuter reports from New
York.
The court, in a 3-to-2 vote, ruled that the islands, off the coast of
Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, have fishing rights up to 24 miles (40km) off
their shores. They were also given a narrow 10.5-mile corridor that
stretches 200 miles into the Atlantic. France had claimed fishing rights
extending 200 miles from both islands. Canada had offered just a 12-mile
limit.
A drilling moratorium in the disputed zone, agreed by both countries in
1967, will be lifted shortly, allowing Canada to award contracts to oil
companies.
The two islands were ceded to France in 1773 by Canada as a haven for French
fishermen.
