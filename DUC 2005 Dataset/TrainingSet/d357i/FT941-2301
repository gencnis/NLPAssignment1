An Icelandic-owned fishing vessel, the Rex, is being held in Stornoway
Harbour, Lewis, for alleged illegal fishing in disputed waters near Rockall
island.
The trawler was spotted by a Fisheries Protection Agency plane on Sunday
about 150 miles west of Rockall, claimed as British territory since 1955. An
agency patrol boat and the Royal Navy vessel HMS Orkney escorted the Rex to
Stornoway. According to the Fishery Limits Act any unlicensed foreign vessel
caught fishing within 200 miles of British territory is breaking the law.
Ownership of Rockall, which is 200 miles west of the Outer Hebrides and
uninhabited, is disputed. Iceland and Denmark claimed in 1985 that Rockall
was within a 'continental-shelf boundary' around their countries, which
would give them territorial rights. The Irish republic also rejects
Britain's claim to the island, which is only a few hundred square yards.
The Foreign Office said: 'As far as we are concerned it is not disputed at
all.'
The waters around Rockall are valuable for fishing and there is strong
evidence of oil below the island.
The skipper of the Rex could be liable for a fine of up to Pounds 50,000.
Mr Helgi Agustsson, Iceland's ambassador to Britain, said his government had
offered the owners help in finding legal assistance.
Iceland maintains that uninhabited rocks are not a basis for the extension
of fishing limits but is not planning to file a claim on Rockall.
