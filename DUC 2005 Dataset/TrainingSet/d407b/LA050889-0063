<P>
This is what happened after Richard E. Leakey, world-renowned paleontologist, 
author and conservationist, head of the Kenya National Museums for 20 years, 
decided to speak out on the issue of wildlife poaching in the country's 
national parks: 
</P>
<P>
Leakey's reputation as a scientist and museum administrator was harshly 
attacked in the local press. The government reorganized the museum board behind 
his back, prompting him to submit his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being a native Kenyan and a citizen, whose younger brother serves in 
the Kenyan Parliament and as deputy tourism minister, Leakey was derided by one 
government minister as a "cheeky white" who felt that black Africans could not 
manage their own affairs. 
</P>
<P>
But in the fullness of time, Leakey's reputation and career have recovered. 
Soon after his resignation, a public uproar forced the government to restore 
the old museum board, and he withdrew his resignation. More recently, Leakey 
became head of the Department of Wildlife Conservation and Management, 
succeeding one of his critics. 
</P>
<P>
For all of that, his experiences underscore one thing: wildlife conservation in 
Kenya is sensitive business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conservation Rivalries 
</P>
<P>
Few events have laid open the rivalries between conservationists and 
bureaucrats -- and among the conservationists themselves -- as a scandal here 
over poaching and Leakey's outspokenness on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
How Kenya undertakes to protect its valued wildlife has long been a tender 
issue, because there is little any developing country can do to combat a gang 
of determined poachers. Many people here feel that the only solution is to 
"privatize" wildlife preserves, by establishing quasi-private companies to run 
existing preserves or otherwise placing them in private hands that can afford 
to safeguard their perimeters. 
</P>
<P>
But Kenyan officials are particularly sensitive to criticism, partly because 
they fear the impact that negative publicity might have on the country's 
significant tourist trade. "After all, most of us want to remain in the 
country," remarked one leading local zoologist, who was reluctant to discuss 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
With a multiplicity of international and local wildlife clubs and funds and 
societies representing a variety of interests and philosophies, Kenyan 
conservationists, like keepers of the flame anywhere, often spend as much time 
sorting out their own differences as they do fighting a common foe. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yes," says Imre Loefler, a local surgeon and prominent conservationist, 
"there are enormous disagreements in the conservation community. This community 
has various traits and prejudices. At one extreme is the most bigoted right 
wing -- strictly anti-humans -- and at the other are those only interested in a 
few species. They're generally employed in the tourist industry." 
</P>
<P>
In few other places, moreover, are the conflicts between the needs of wildlife 
protection and those of the human population so sharply etched as in Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife is Kenya's greatest tourist draw, and tourism its third-largest 
foreign exchange earner: The 700,000 visitors expected this year will leave 
behind well over $350 million in foreign currency. With coffee and tea prices 
locked in a long slump, tourism may be Kenya's only growth industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competing With Humans 
</P>
<P>
Yet Kenya's elephants, rhinos, lions and antelope occupy land that comes at an 
increasing premium and for which they must compete ever more aggressively with 
the country's human population, which is growing faster than that of any other 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
In Narok, a farm district next to Masai Mara National Park, one of Kenya's most 
popular game reserves, a herd of elephants not long ago invaded a plantation of 
bananas and vegetables; in their haste to reach the food, they trampled a woman 
to death. In Tana River district, which includes part of Tsavo East Game 
Reserve, 88 people have been killed by animals since 1980, according to the 
Department of Tourism and Wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
"With growing population pressures, one has to show the politicians that 
setting aside preserves is economically productive, whether that involves 
tourism, hunting or exploitation" such as harvesting ivory, Loefler says. "You 
can't tell people anymore that we're just going to do this for sentimental 
reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the underlying tension is a racial element: The wildlife conservation 
community here largely comprises white expatriate Europeans and Americans, some 
of whom may not be fully sensitive to the competing interests of a poor and 
developing land. 
</P>
<P>
What set all this tinder aflame was an apparent surge of poaching late last 
year in Kenya's national parks. Tourists began returning from safaris in the 
parks, not with tales of bongo on the hoof and lions at repose yawning in the 
grass and trees, but of mountains of elephant carcasses, with trunks and tusks 
ghoulishly lopped off. 
</P>
<P>
Reports reached Nairobi of poaching gangs armed with automatic weapons engaging 
park rangers in lengthy shoot-outs. In November, Perez Olindo, Leakey's 
predecessor as director of Wildlife and Conservation Management, detailed the 
six-month war's casualties: six game rangers killed, nine wounded. 
</P>
<P>
In the longer term, Olindo said, poaching had reduced Kenya's elephant 
population in 13 years from 140,000 to 22,000. Other unofficial estimates 
placed the elephant population as low as 16,000. 
</P>
<P>
It was into this ferment that Leakey jumped with both feet last fall. Just 
after Tourism and Wildlife Minister George Muhoho called a news conference to 
pledge a redoubled government anti-poaching effort, Leakey called his own 
conference as chairman of the East African Wildlife Society. 
</P>
<P>
Calling poaching "a growing national crisis" and "economic sabotage," he 
labeled the government's approach toward wildlife protection "lip service" and 
charged that high officials of the wildlife department itself were 
participating in poaching. The remarks by Leakey, one of the few Kenyans of his 
stature to speak out, brought the poaching issue to the forefront of national 
and international attention. 
</P>
<P>
The elder son of the late Louis Leakey, whose work at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania 
was critical in the study of early man, Leakey has made many important 
discoveries himself. His directorship of the national museums is widely 
regarded as having given those institutions a preeminent position in study of 
prehistory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family's Prominent Role 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there could be few white families who have played as prominent a role 
as natives and citizens in Kenya's post-independence period as have the 
Leakeys. 
</P>
<P>
Muhoho at first replied with what Kenya's leading newspaper, the Daily Nation, 
later disapprovingly termed a "contentious response": He called Leakey a 
"cheeky white." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, it was not only Kenyan officials who felt Leakey had shot from the hip. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question whatsoever that he was doing a bit of grandstanding," said 
David Western, chairman of the governing council of the Wildlife Clubs of 
Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, the wildlife rangers temporarily recovered some of their morale. 
The government staffed the parks with a detachment of its paramilitary General 
Services Unit, 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mounds of Carcasses 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, in succeeding months, it has become clear that the tide of 
poaching in the national parks, particularly of elephants, has not appreciably 
been stemmed. Mounds of carcasses still appear, and public concern over the 
situation has not abated. 
</P>
<P>
Leakey's outburst may finally have borne its most important fruit last month 
when he got a chance to take full charge of correcting the ills he has 
complained about. The government appointed him to replace Olindo as the man 
directly responsible for protecting Kenya's wildlife.
