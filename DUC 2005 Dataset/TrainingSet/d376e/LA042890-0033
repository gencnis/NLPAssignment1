LITHUANIA'S STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

It's fascinating to watch the Bush Administration's reaction to the Soviet 
Union's embargo against Lithuania. Maybe we'll go full circle; the World Court 
can condemn this action and then the Soviets can defy that body, just as the 
United States defied the court's condemnation of our embargo of Nicaragua.

<P>
We've been trying for years to redesign the Soviet Union in our image, and it 
seems we have made a start. So far the Soviets haven't mined Lithuania's 
harbors as we did Nicaragua's, nor organized a Contra-style terrorist force to 
conduct hit-and-run raids across the border. Perhaps the Soviet Union will 
follow our example all the way and put up its own hand-picked slate in the next 
Lithuanian election and then spend millions to support that slate.

<P>
Isn't it great that the world is finally following our example?
