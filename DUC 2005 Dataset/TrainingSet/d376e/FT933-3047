THE United Nations last night elected eight judges for the international war
crimes tribunal that will try those accused of murders and other atrocities
in former Yugoslavia since 1991, writes Michael Littlejohns in New York.
But three more jurists are needed to complete the court and secret balloting
will resume in the general assembly today.
The tribunal will be based at The Hague and is due to begin work on November
15. But it could be months before the judges - each of whom will receive an
annual stipend of Dollars 145,000 (Pounds 94,155) - hear their first case
and then not in the Netherlands but closer to former Yugoslavia.
The court, the first to deal with war crimes since the Nuremberg and Tokyo
tribunals after the second world war, will not impose the death penalty.
Governments are being asked to volunteer to incarcerate those convicted and
sentenced.
The US has already named as suspected war criminals Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic and Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, for
their alleged responsibility for mass killings by Serb forces.
To be elected, each nominee required a majority of 94 votes in the
184-nation assembly. A black American jurist, Ms Gabrielle McDonald, came
top of the list with 137 votes.
Other judges elected included Sir Ninian Stephen, a former governor-general
of Australia.
