An international war crimes tribunal covering the former Yugoslavia formally
opens in The Hague today with a request for the extradiction from Germany of
a Bosnian Serb alleged to have killed three Moslem prisoners. The
prosecutor, Mr Richard Goldstone, a South African judge, will ask Germany to
hand over Mr Dusan Tadic, who is alleged to have murdered the prisoners at
the Omarska concentration camp in Serb-held northwestern Bosnia in 1992. Mr
Tadic was arrested in Germany last year.
The extradiction is important to the tribunal - the first international war
crimes court since the Nuremberg trials after the second world war - because
it has no power to try suspects in absentia. Jail cells have been set aside
in a Dutch prison in The Hague, but so far they remain empty.
