US biotechnology companies will not need special approval to market food
products they develop, as long as they do not drastically alter the genetic
make-up of the food, the White House said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Washington.
The policy proclamation decrees that genetically engineered foods - emerging
strains ranging from tomatoes to cucumbers and melons - are not inherently
more dangerous than other products and do not need extensive pre-marketing
tests. The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates most US foods, will
not require identifying labels on genetically altered products under the new
policy.
The policy decision was expected and fiercely opposed by some consumer
watchdogs, on health and safety grounds. But the White House rejected their
fears that fruits and vegetables genetically altered to produce tastier,
more nutritious or longer-lived produce might be dangerous.
Under the policy the FDA will require pre-market testing only if products
are altered in such a way that safety issues are raised. One example might
be if a new product was unlike anything that had been safety-tested before.
