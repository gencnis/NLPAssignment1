US biotechnology companies will not need special approval to market food
products they develop, as long as they do not drastically alter the genetic
make-up of the food, the White House said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Washington.
The policy proclamation decrees that genetically engineered foods - emerging
strains ranging from tomatoes to cucumbers and melons - are not inherently
more dangerous than other products and do not need extensive pre-marketing
tests. The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates most US foods, will
not require identifying labels on genetically altered products under the new
policy.
The policy decision was expected and fiercely opposed by some consumer
watchdogs, on health and safety grounds. But the White House rejected their
fears that fruits and vegetables genetically altered to produce tastier,
more nutritious or longer-lived produce might be dangerous.
'The US is already the world leader in biotechnology and we want to keep it
that way,' Mr Dan Quayle, vice-president, said when announcing the policy.
Under the policy the FDA will require pre-market testing only if products
are altered in such a way that safety issues are raised. One example might
be if a new product was unlike anything that had been safety-tested before.
The guidelines should be a boon for agricultural biotechnology companies,
which have fretted for years that pre-market approval of genetic goods might
be required.
There are about 2,000 biotechnology companies in the US, but only about 10
per cent are involved in the food sector.
New techniques like cell-cloning or gene-transfer have raised hopes of
hardier breeds, but also some fears.
The Foundation for Economic Trends, run by Mr Jeremy Rifkin, a consumer
activist, filed a petition with the FDA on May 18 asking for tight rules on
biotechnology.
