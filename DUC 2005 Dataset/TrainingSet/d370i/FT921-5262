THE government is to press ahead with its own plans to regulate nutrition
claims on food labels, after losing patience with the European Commission's
failure to issue promised proposals for Community-wide controls.
Mr David MacLean, the food minister, said in a Commons written reply
yesterday that he hoped its decision would influence the commission's
thinking and encourage it to take action soon. Though the government expects
the commission to bar it from introducing its own rules for 12 months,
Whitehall hopes yesterday's announcement will increase pressure on Brussels
to speed up its deliberations.
The EC council of ministers approved two years ago a directive requiring
that food products making nutrition claims, such as 'low-fat' or
'high-fibre', should carry information on their labels about the nutrients
they contain.
The directive is due to take effect in October next year. However, proposals
are still awaited from the commission for firm standards which food
manufacturers would have to meet to justify such nutrition claims.
Three years ago the government accepted recommendations for such standards
by Britain's Food Advisory Committee, a panel of experts which includes food
industry representatives.
However, it suspended further action after the commission said it would
propose EC-wide controls.
The government has now called for comment on the committee's proposals and
says it plans to introduce its own regulations in October next year if there
is still no prospect of EC controls by then.
