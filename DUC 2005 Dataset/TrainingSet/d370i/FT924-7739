FT  14 NOV 92 / Letter: Use of food additives essential to urban living

Sir, Your article, 'Prawn crisps and politics' (November 10), starts from
the unfortunate assumption that foods which contain additives cannot be
"full of taste and goodness".
It is worth pointing out that even so-called "natural" food materials are
not all attractive or even safe to eat in their natural state. If untreated,
they will deteriorate. The use of additives to preserve foods is therefore
crucial.
Without additives it would be impossible to feed our modern urban
population. There would be a dramatic reduction in the number and variety of
foods available, and a significant increase in food poisoning and food-borne
diseases.
The increase in the approved additives when the Single European Act comes
into force does not mean a lowering of standards, because every additive
must still undergo stringent safety checks by independent scientists at EC
level. An "E" initial signifies that an additive has passed those tests.
Your readers may be interested to know that the standards are so high that
many so-called "natural" foods, including the potato, would fail because of
their minute quantities of toxin.
A small proportion of people may be intolerant to some additives. However,
while between 0.01 per cent and 0.2 per cent of the population may be
intolerant to food additives such as tartrazine, between one and two people
in every 100 are intolerant to certain constituents of milk.
The food industry recognises that labelling information is important to help
people avoid the ingredients to which they may be intolerant and, in
association with the Royal College of Physicians and the British Dietetic
Association, the Food and Drink Federation has set up a databank listing
more than 4,000 branded food products free of ingredients that may cause
adverse reactions. Michael Mackenzie
