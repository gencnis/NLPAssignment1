The Food and Drug Administration said today a purported diet cookie made here 
will remain on the market pending modification of its labels that apparently 
contain false calorie and nutrition information. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Johnson, FDA district director, met Wednesday with Phoenix International 
Marketing Corp. to discuss the problem with the labels and promotions that 
claim allegedly unproven weight loss and health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco-based director said that no agreement was reached on how to 
change the labels but that the company made several suggestions on fixing the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
The cookie is advertised as having just two grams of fat, 10 grams of dietary 
fiber and 126 calories. The company claims that eating the cookie can help 
people lose up to 14 pounds in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But tests at Mississippi State University found that the average Phoenix Cookie 
has half the fiber, twice the calories and five times the fat its makers claim.
