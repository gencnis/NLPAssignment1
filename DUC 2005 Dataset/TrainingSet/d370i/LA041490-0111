The Food and Drug Administration has cited Ragu Foods Inc. for misleading 
consumers with its "Ragu New! Fresh Italian 100% Natural Pasta Sauce" labeling 
in violation of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. 
</P>
<P>
This time, it was the word "fresh" and not the word "natural" that was the 
sticking point, said Allen Halper, assistant to the director of the Division of 
Regulatory Guidance at the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
"The term 'fresh' in the food name is false and misleading in the labels of 
these foods, which have been made in part from tomato paste and have been 
heat-processed, preserved or cured," Halper said. "Also, the name 'Italian' 
implies a geographic origin of the food" that it does not have. 
</P>
<P>
Ragu must now advise the FDA in writing what it plans to do about the labeling, 
said Donald Plumb, an FDA consumer safety officer. Plumb said the company plans 
to respond by April 20. MARIA L. La GANGA
