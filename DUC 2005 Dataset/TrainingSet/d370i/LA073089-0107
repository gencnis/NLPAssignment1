Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan said Friday that he asked 
the Food and Drug Administration to consider major changes in government food 
labeling standards. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA is expected to propose a federal rule on the various aspects of food 
labeling early next year. The agency has long required labeling listing 
ingredients, net weight and nutritional information on foods. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said there is no comprehensive, mandatory food labeling requirement 
for nutritional labeling for all foods, despite the government's efforts to 
improve food labeling.
