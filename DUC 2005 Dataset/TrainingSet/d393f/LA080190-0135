Florida officials signed clemency orders today for an 81-year-old man convicted 
of shooting his ailing wife in what he said was a mercy killing. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Bob Martinez and three Cabinet members signed the order for health reasons 
with the conditions that Roswell Gilbert keep contact with probation officers 
and not possess any weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert could be released from prison as early as Thursday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"A just society is one that tempers the need for punishment with the compassion 
that is our hallmark as a people," said Martinez, who three years ago rejected 
Gilbert's clemency request. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Gilbert's declining health, and the likelihood that his condition will 
continue to deteriorate if he remains in prison, leads me to the conclusion 
that he should be granted clemency," Martinez said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert is serving a minimum mandatory sentence of life without chance of 
parole for 25 years for killing his wife, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease 
and osteoporosis. He was the subject of a 1987 television movie that dramatized 
his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"O Lord, it's just such wonderful news," said Gilbert's daughter, Martha Moran, 
in Baltimore. "It's just wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Dad last Thursday," she said. "He was doing OK considering the 
circumstances. I know he will be absolutely thrilled to death at getting out, 
of course." 
</P>
<P>
Moran said she will return to Florida immediately to help her father resettle. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the readjustment to life outside the prison won't be too difficult for 
him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert was examined in January, and a medical report by Dr. Irene Cody showed 
that he suffered from heart and lung disease and was considered "at high risk 
of death at any time" because of his age and physical condition. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution claimed that Gilbert, a retired engineer, killed his 
72-year-old wife, Emily, in March, 1985, after 51 years of marriage because she 
had become a burden to him.
