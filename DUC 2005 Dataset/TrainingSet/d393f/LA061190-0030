Friends and relatives gathered at the First Unitarian Church in Portland, Ore., 
for a memorial service for Janet Elaine Adkins, 54, who used a controversial 
machine to commit suicide last week in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Adkins had planned the joyful, hourlong ceremony before traveling to Michigan, 
where Dr. Jack Kevorkian hooked her up to the suicide machine he invented. She 
touched a button, releasing an anesthetic followed by a lethal injection. 
Seconds later, she was dead. Adkins was suffering from Alzheimer's disease and 
feared mental deterioration.
