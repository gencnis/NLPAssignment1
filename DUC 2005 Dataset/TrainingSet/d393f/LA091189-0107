<TEXT>
<P>
A West German nurse dubbed "the angel of death" was sentenced to 11 years in 
prison today for killing patients with lethal injections to end their 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
Michaela Roeder, 31, was found guilty of six counts of manslaughter and one 
each of attempted manslaughter and mercy killing. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence and the court's decision that 
compassion was Roeder's motive angered some members of the public in the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Unsuspecting colleagues called Roeder "the angel of death" because of the 
number of people who died while she was on duty.
