The Cook County, Ill., medical examiner has ruled that a 15-month-old boy 
unhooked by his father from a respirator died of accidental causes. Dr. Robert 
J. Stein made the ruling the day after a grand jury in Chicago refused to 
indict Rudolfo Linares, 23, who removed his son's life-support and held off 
hospital staff with a gun April 26. Samuel Linares had been comatose since 
accidentally swallowing a balloon last August. Officials at 
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center had refused the family's request to 
withdraw life-support. Stein said he reviewed the grand jury's decision before 
changing the death certificate from undetermined to accidental.
