A paralyzed 50-year-old woman died today just minutes after doctors unhooked 
her life support system -- a move a judge ruled did not need court approval as 
long as it was requested by the patient. 
</P>
<P>
After a bedside meeting with her sister and her favorite nurse, Dr. James 
Sullivan unhooked the respirator that had kept Nancy Gamble alive for 14 months 
at Baptist Hospital, her attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Gamble, 50, who was paralyzed by the incurable Lou Gehrig's disease, died 
"peacefully" 15 minutes later this morning, attorney Mary Martin Schaffner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson County Chancellor Robert Brandt ruled Tuesday in the right-to-die suit 
Gamble filed after Baptist Hospital refused to let her physician remove her 
respirator. 
</P>
<P>
The judge ruled that Gamble's physician could remove her respirator and for the 
first time in Tennessee, he also decided that physicians may act without any 
court's permission to honor a disabled patient's wish to die. 
</P>
<P>
Disabled rights activists protested Brandt's decision, calling it "further 
movement down the slippery slope of euthanasia of individuals whom society may 
perceive as unwanted burdens." 
</P>
<P>
But Brandt said: "This case does not involve suicide and it does not involve 
euthanasia. This case does not belong in court." 
</P>
<P>
The judge ruled that physicians may unhook the respirators of disabled patients 
as long as the patients are mentally competent, fully informed of their 
condition and voluntarily deciding to die. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt called it discriminatory to "impose the cumbersome legal process" on the 
disabled trying to decide their own medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"This court finds they should have the same right to decide their future as 
those who are not totally disabled," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for ADAPT, or American Disabled for Attendant Programs Today, urged 
the court to assure that Gamble is offered suicide prevention counseling. 
</P>
<P>
ADAPT argued in court papers that Gamble could have lived independently with 
attendants to care for her at home and that she could have operated a computer 
with her mouth to communicate better. 
</P>
<P>
"Terminal illness should not be used to justify a wholesale abandonment of 
society's policies designed to protect human life," the group said. 
</P>
<P>
Schaffner said Brandt's ruling is the first in Tennessee to say disabled 
patients no longer must seek court permission to have respirators removed.
