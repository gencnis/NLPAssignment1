A brain-dead teen-ager was removed from life-support equipment Friday, two days 
after giving birth to a premature daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Tanya Marie Rivera, 15, had been kept on life-support systems after county 
officials rejected the initial pleas of her parents not to do so. 
</P>
<P>
She died at 12:58 p.m. at San Bernardino County Medical Center, while her 
2-day-old daughter remained in very critical condition with lung problems, 
according to a hospital statement. 
</P>
<P>
"The parents of Tanya Rivera met with administrators and physicians responsible 
for her care and it was jointly decided that continuing to keep Tanya on 
life-support would serve no purpose," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager was declared brain dead March 15 after she suffered a gunshot 
wound to the head, which police say was inflicted by her 16-year-old boyfriend, 
a reputed gang member who is believed to be the newborn's father. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed against the boy, who is in jail in Los Angeles on an 
unrelated murder charge.
