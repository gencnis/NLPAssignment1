The Supreme Court, in its first ruling in a "right-to-die" case, said today 
states may bar the removal of life-sustaining treatment from comatose patients 
who have not made or cannot make their desires known. 
</P>
<P>
By a 5-4 vote, the justices blocked the parents of a permanently unconscious 
Missouri woman, Nancy Cruzan, from ordering the removal of tubes that provide 
her with food and water. 
</P>
<P>
The court said Cruzan's rights were not violated by allowing the state's 
interest in preserving life to outweigh her parents' wishes. 
</P>
<P>
But the court, indirectly supporting so-called "living will" laws, said the 
Constitution guarantees a competent person a right to refuse medical treatment. 
That issue was not presented squarely in the Cruzan case since she is 
incompetent to decide her future, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Kurtenbach, who has worked with the Cruzans as head of the Kansas City, 
Mo., office of the American Civil Liberties Union, commented: 
</P>
<P>
"When we looked at it realistically, and with the recent history of the court, 
this is not that surprising. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the family is going to be extremely disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said Missouri may 
require "clear and convincing" proof that Cruzan wants to die before allowing 
the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment. Such evidence is lacking in 
Cruzan's case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The chief justice also said that "not all incompetent patients will have loved 
ones available to serve as surrogate decision makers. A state is entitled to 
guard against potential abuses in such situations." 
</P>
<P>
"In sum, we conclude that a state may apply a clear and convincing evidence 
standard in proceedings where a guardian seeks to discontinue nutrition and 
hydration of a person diagnosed to be in a persistent vegetative state," 
Rehnquist said. 
</P>
<P>
He was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin J. 
Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Dissenting were Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. 
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan, in an opinion joined by Marshall and Blackmun, said, "Nancy Cruzan is 
entitled to choose to die with dignity." 
</P>
<P>
Missouri and the Supreme Court "have displaced Nancy's own assessment of the 
processes associated with dying," Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
"They have discarded evidence of her will, ignored her values, and deprived her 
of the right to a decision as closely approximating her own choice as humanly 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
But Brennan said he is heartened that the court tentatively concluded that in 
some cases a competent person must be allowed to choose death. 
</P>
<P>
State courts generally have permitted removal of life-sustaining treatment for 
patients like Cruzan.
