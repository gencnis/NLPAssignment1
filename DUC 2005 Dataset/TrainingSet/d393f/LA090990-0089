A 72-year-old man who said love moved him to complete his terminally ill wife's 
suicide attempt was ordered Friday to stand trial on murder and conspiracy 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Bertram Harper faces mandatory life imprisonment if convicted of conspiring to 
murder his 69-year-old wife, Virginia, who died Aug. 19 in the motel room they 
rented after flying to Michigan from their home in Loomis, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Harper planned her suicide after learning she was terminally ill with 
breast and liver cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The murder case against Harper rests largely on his telling police that he put 
a plastic bag over his wife's head and secured it around her neck after a 
non-lethal combination of pills and alcohol caused her to fall asleep. 
</P>
<P>
The official cause of death was asphyxiation, according to the Wayne County 
medical examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
District Judge Henry Zaborowski ordered Harper tried on one count of open 
murder -- which may be defined at trial as first- or second-degree murder, or 
manslaughter -- and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. 
</P>
<P>
Shanda McGrew, 40, Mrs. Harper's daughter and Harper's stepdaughter, flew to 
Michigan with them and was present at her mother's death. She is an unindicted 
co-conspirator in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Zaborowski let Harper return to California under $25,000 bond. He probably will 
not have to return to Michigan until his trial begins in late October or early 
November, defense lawyer Hugh Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, a retired engineer, was asked after the hearing whether he feared 
spending the rest of his life in prison. "I don't think it's ever going to get 
to that point," he replied. "But if it comes to that, I'm 72 years old. I don't 
have that much time left." 
</P>
<P>
Hours after his wife's death, Harper told police they had chose to come to 
Michigan because they believed the state had no law making it illegal to assist 
in a suicide. Under California law, such an act is a felony, punishable by up 
to five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Harper cited a 1983 Michigan Court of Appeals ruling listed in a book by Derek 
Humphry, executive director of the Hemlock Society, which advocates death on 
demand for the terminally ill. Mrs. Harper was a member of the Eugene, 
Ore.-based group, which is paying for Harper's legal defense. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Wayne County prosecutor Timothy Kenny argued that the ruling did not 
outweigh a 1920 case in which the state Supreme Court upheld the first-degree 
murder conviction of a man who mixed poison for his ailing wife and left it 
within her reach. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny argued that Harper, in tying the bag over his sleeping wife's head and 
not calling police until an hour after she stopped breathing, did more than 
simply assist in her death. 
</P>
<P>
Under Michigan law, first-degree murder is punished by mandatory life 
imprisonment; second-degree murder by up to life imprisonment, and manslaughter 
by up to 15 years in prison.
