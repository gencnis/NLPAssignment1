Maximo Rene Menendez, 25, collapsed on July 26 after drinking from a six-ounce 
bottle of Pony Malta de Bavaria. FBI experts have discovered at least 45 
contaminated bottles containing 20 to 40 grams of the drug in a 1,000-case 
shipment of the soft drink. Federal officials warned consumers that hundreds of 
cases of Pony Malta distributed in southern Florida are unaccounted for.
