A 26-year-old stabbing victim whose life-support system was disconnected eight 
days ago over the objections of his assailant died today nearly four years 
after the attack that left him in a coma.

Sylvia Lane said her son, Mark Weaver, died at about 2 a.m. "He died 
peacefully. He never had a moment's pain," she said. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy was being performed today at the request of the state attorney 
general's office. 
</P>

Weaver's feeding tube was removed last week after a probate judge ruled that 
Weaver's assailant, Noel Pagan, could not intervene. Pagan, who has served 
three years in prison for aggravated assault in the 1985 attack, feared he 
would be charged with murder if Weaver died. State prosecutors have declined to 
say whether they will bring a new charge against Pagan.
