TWO portraits, one by Reynolds, the other by Gainsborough, which had been
stolen from the Great Hall at Lincoln's Inn in London in 1990, were
recovered this week when they were brought into Sotheby's for evaluation.
They had been bought at the Bermondsey market in London for Pounds 145 for
the two, and the new owner, who had no idea of their provenance, carried the
two canvases to the auction house in a plastic bin liner.
Ms Lucy Hodson, of Sotheby's British pictures department, was called down to
the front desk to examine the paintings and immediately recognised them as
the work of Reynolds and Gainsborough.
She checked with the Art Loss Register and discovered they were the missing
paintings.
'I could not believe my eyes when this man pulled these two paintings from
the bin bag,' she said. 'Both of them had been taken from their frames when
they were stolen and the Gainsborough was rolled up. The Reynolds is smaller
and was still on its stretcher but I recognised them straight away.'
A portrait of William Pitt the Younger by Gainsborough, which was also
stolen in the raid, has yet to be recovered.
