Stolen Warhol Works Recovered: Amsterdam police said Wednesday that they have 
recovered stolen lithographs by the late U.S. pop artist Andy Warhol worth more 
than $1 million. The 81 works were stolen from a West German gallery near Bonn 
last September. Police arrested a 35-year-old Dutch dealer and two buyers 
Tuesday night after a tip-off that the dealer was selling some of the works in 
a local hotel. They recovered 14 lithographs. The other 67 Warhols were found 
in a house search. Police arrested two Britons and two Yugoslavs, seizing 
firearms and a large amount of cash. ALEENE MacMINN
