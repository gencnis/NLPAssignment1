A man suspected of stealing a million-dollar collection of hundreds of ancient 
Nepalese and Tibetan art objects in New York 11 years ago was arrested Thursday 
at his South Los Angeles home, where he had been hiding the antiquities, police 
said.

Craig Warner, 40, was arrested at his home on suspicion of receiving and 
transporting stolen property and was being held on $5,000 bail, said Detective 
William Martin, the Police Department's art crimes specialist.

The collection is made up of hundreds of Tibetan and Nepalese statues and art 
objects, many dating to the 8th Century. The antiquities, many of them 
depictions of Oriental gods, were stolen Christmas Day, 1978, from the 
Manhattan home of antiquities collector Jane Werner, Martin said. Martin said 
the suspect and Werner were acquaintances in New York and that Warner had been 
an original suspect in the case.
