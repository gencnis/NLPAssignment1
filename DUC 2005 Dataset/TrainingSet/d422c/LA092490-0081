French police recovered five masterpieces stolen from Paris museums last 
summer, including a small work by Renoir.

Police arrested Richard Etoh-Mvondo, 21, and said he confessed to stealing the 
paintings and a small 15th-Century statue. They said he also had stolen a 1470 
portrait by Italian painter Lazzaro Bastiani from a Venice museum last week. He 
led police to Lyon, where the works were recovered, including Renoir's 
"Portrait of a Seated Woman" cut from its frame at the Louvre on July 4 during 
visiting hours.
