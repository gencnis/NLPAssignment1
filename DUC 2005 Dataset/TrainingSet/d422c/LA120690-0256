Clues from Japan led police to a stolen masterpiece by Claude Monet that gave 
its name to Impressionism, a French police chief said today. 
</P>
<P>
Monet's "Impression Sunrise" and eight other Impressionist works were taken 
from a Paris museum five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
All nine were recovered from a villa on the French island of Corsica on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mireille Ballestrazzi, head of France's art theft police squad, said more than 
12 suspects were being held. One was handed over to a judge, who will decide 
whether to press charges. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether those arrested included the hooded bandits who raided 
the Marmottan Museum in broad daylight. 
</P>
<P>
Ballestrazzi said she found the first clues three years ago during an 
investigation in Japan, where experts feared the works could have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
"We got some testimonies that led us to Corsica step by step," she said in a 
television interview. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from Monet's 1872 masterpiece -- a misty dawn in Normandy that gave its 
name to the Impressionist movement -- the nine recovered paintings included two 
by Auguste Renoir. 
</P>
<P>
Two were slightly damaged.
