Two Dutchmen were each jailed for five years today for stealing three paintings 
by Vincent van Gogh last year in the Netherlands' biggest art theft. 
</P>
<P>
A Dutch court convicted Anton Willem Baeten, 37, and Anton Overweel, 30, for 
stealing the paintings worth up to $100 million from the Kroeller-Mueller 
Museum and demanding a ransom for their return. 
</P>
<P>
One of the stolen paintings, "Weaver's Loom and Weaver," was recovered last 
April when the thieves left it in a car trunk and said they would destroy the 
other two unless they received $2.2 million. The other two paintings, "Wilted 
Sunflowers," and "The Potato Eaters," were recovered in July after the men's 
arrest.
