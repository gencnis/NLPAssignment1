Two men charged in the theft of a 17th-Century Dutch painting from an Antelope 
Valley College art show last month have pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Jereld Sharitz, a 23-year-old art student at the college, was charged with 
grand theft. Timothy Cain, Sharitz's 27-year-old roommate, was charged as an 
accessory, a Lancaster Municipal Court official said. The $18,000 artwork, 
"Nymphs Gathering Flowers in a Landscape" by Gerard Hoet the Elder, was stolen 
from the college art gallery Nov. 6 during an exhibit of European paintings.

Sharitz and Cain were arrested Nov. 28 after investigators acting on a tip 
served a search warrant at the apartment of the two men and found the painting. 
The suspects entered not guilty pleas Friday and face a preliminary hearing 
Jan. 11.
