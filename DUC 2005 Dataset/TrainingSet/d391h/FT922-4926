BRITISH Biotechnology Group yesterday published the pathfinder prospectus
for its international share offer planned for July.
The Oxford-based pharmaceutical company says it aims to raise some Pounds
30m by selling about 20 per cent of its equity through a share issue in
London and New York. The issue is expected to be priced at between 400p and
450p, valuing the company at about Pounds 150m.
British Biotechnology will use the proceeds of the flotation primarily to
fund its research and development programme, which covers four medical
areas: inflammatory diseases such as arthritis; cancer; vascular and heart
disease; and viral infections, including Aids.
It has two drugs undergoing in early clinical trials and a third due to
begin clinical testing in August. But the group 'does not expect to market
or generate revenues from the commercialisation of its pharmaceutical
products until at least the latter half of the 1990s.'
