FT  21 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market was too quick to interpret yesterday's half-year figures from
Glaxo as evidence that Zantac is faltering. Underlying growth of the ulcer
drug was certainly down on the most recent 12-month period, but a buyers'
strike in Italy and an obligatory Medicaid refund in the US exaggerated the
trend. Even with these disappointments Glaxo's overall sales at constant
exchange rates increased by an impressive 18 per cent in the six months,
against just 16 per cent for the financial year 1991 as a whole.
Prospects for the new generation of Glaxo drugs are little clearer. The
anti-emetic product Zofran looks like hitting Pounds 250m of sales for the
full year, but the question remains whether it can be sold to treat other
illnesses. The jury remains out on Imigran, which looks set to receive US
approval this summer, and on scare-affected Serevent. Investors will take
more encouragement from news that marketing expenses should fall as a
proportion of sales, and that increases in R &amp; D spending will in future
mirror sales growth. Both developments are good for margins.
With perhaps one third of the equity now in US hands the key to the next
share price move almost certainly lies on Wall Street. Comparisons may be
pertinent with 1983, a year when the world economy was coming out of
recession and Zantac won approval in the US. The first half then saw
continued outperformance, though on the back of the sort of heavy US demand
which nine years later may have run out of steam. The second half of 1983
saw a sharp underperformance, more than wiping out the relative gains of the
first six months.
