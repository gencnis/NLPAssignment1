SMITHKLINE Beecham, the second-biggest drug company in Britain, is to spend
more than Pounds 200m consolidating its research and development centres.
The company said yesterday that no jobs would be lost but 1,000 people would
be asked to relocate.
SmithKline is buying the 40-acre site of BP's maritime centre in Harlow,
Essex, which is next to one of its existing research centres.
This will enable it to stop research at four of its seven centres, at
Brockham Park, Great Burgh and Reigate in Surrey, and at Worthing in Sussex.
The research headquarters will move from Great Burgh to Harlow.
The company said: 'There will be significant cost savings through reduction
in operating costs by maintaining fewer sites.'
It said that staff now travelled 1.5m miles a year between sites and that
more people on a single site would 'improve interactions and efficiency'.
The acquisition also 'provides enough land to eventually consolidate all UK
pharmaceutical R&amp;D in one location, if desired'.
The Pounds 200m capital cost of the scheme, and the costs of relocation,
have already been accounted for by the company in provisions for the
restructuring of its research side.
SmithKline's plan comes when the drug sector is under increasing pressure to
cut prices from governments anxious to reduce health spending.
All staff will be offered relocation assistance. The company conceded that
some might be offered redundancy, but that 'the object is not to reduce
numbers'.
The Reigate centre will close next year when the lease runs out. Most
non-research staff will have moved by the third quarter of next year.
Remaining employees will be transferred by 1997.
R&amp;D will by then be concentrated at just three sites: Harlow, Tonbridge in
Kent, and Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire.
