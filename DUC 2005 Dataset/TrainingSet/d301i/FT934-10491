FOR the US government, the war against drugs begins overseas. But if its
measure of success is the quantity of narcotics flowing into the country,
then it has failed.
'The simple fact of the matter is that after spending billions of dollars on
the interdiction effort, more cocaine and more heroin enters the country
today than before the first drug strategy was released in 1989,' a
congressional report concluded last month.
This sense of failure led the Clinton administration to announce a shift in
strategy last month. But the shift - which reduces the emphasis on
interdiction and aims to increase US spending in the source countries - has
disappointed most followers of the drugs issue.
'This is just another stage of the cycle of the international drugs war,'
said Mr Kevin Zeese of the reform-oriented Drugs Policy Foundation. 'It's a
good thing they've recognised the failure of interdiction but they are
chasing the cat's tail. Nixon focuses on interdiction, Carter on
eradication, Reagan and Bush go back to military spending and interdiction,
then Clinton focuses again on the source countries.'
The Clinton administration has tried to frame its anti-narcotics strategy
overseas within its foreign policy emphasis on democracy and human rights.
'Counter-narcotics is an integral part of what we are trying to do with
foreign policy,' said Mr Richard Porter, director of national security
affairs in the Office of National Drug Control Policy. 'Trafficking,
corruption, drug use, economic dislocation, instability and human rights
problems are more likely when democratic institutions are fragile, which is
why the traffickers are there.'
Interdiction - involving coastguard and naval operations and AWACS aerial
surveillance mainly in the Caribbean - has been expensive. The Pentagon,
which controls these operations, has been criticised for wasting millions of
tax dollars and for diverting non-drug enforcement activities to drug
enforcement accounts.
Yet officials insist these efforts have had a significant impact on the
Colombian cartels which dominate the cocaine trade and are moving into the
heroin business.
According to Mr Porter: 'The question is not whether it's been a success or
not. It has been a success. It's a matter of looking, as the dollars get
scarcer, at where we can get more bang for the buck.'
The efforts have increased interceptions, which have forced significant
changes in the cartels' methods, he said. Seizures - amounting to 107 tonnes
in the three years from 1989 to 1992 - have cost the cartels billions of
dollars.
Furthermore, instead of transporting the cocaine in bulk through Florida as
was common a few years ago, they are now forced to make smaller shipments.
But there would be greater cost effectiveness if the traffickers were
tackled in source countries: 'That's the beehive. If we want the bees, the
best place to get them is in the hive. Otherwise we are chasing them all
over the forest where they are harder and harder to find,' Mr Porter said.
Yet, drugs policy experts are worried that such a shift would merely move
funds from one part of the Defence Department to another. Meanwhile, despite
the administration's emphasis on building democracy, this part of the
strategy would be viewed as foreign aid and therefore highly vulnerable to
cuts by Congress.
Furthermore, the attempt to identify a successful drugs policy with
democracy is likely to be confusing. 'It's a recipe for ineffective policy,'
says Mr Peter Hakim of the Washington-based InterAmerican Dialogue.
Though there is criticism of the drugs policy for placing too much emphasis
overseas, only 9 per cent of the Dollars 12.7bn budget in 1993 was spent
outside the US and less than 4 per cent was spent in joint programmes with
other governments, the majority of which was in the Andean countries.
The new efforts, say officials, would build on improved co-operation already
evident, particularly with Bolivia and Colombia, in the Andes.
A senior State Department official said these efforts would aim to provide
increased help with the administration of justice. Help with eradication
would continue but there would be greater emphasis on alternative
development and crop substitution. The US would also seek support in these
objectives from the international financial institutions.
But these objectives are difficult and succeed, if at all, only in the
long-term. Furthermore, eradication efforts - as has been shown in the Latin
American centre for coca production in Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley - have
only succeeded in shifting production elsewhere.
Alternative crops, such as cocoa, coffee and palm-oil, occasionally fetch
higher prices on the international market to make them competitive with
coca. But drugs dealers can always raise the prices they are prepared to pay
for coca leaf to levels which keep coca-growers hooked.
This is the root of the problem. The difference between the price of cocaine
on the other side of the border and the price on the US side means that
efforts to stem supply almost inevitably looked doomed to failure.

NARCOTICS: THE MAIN TRADE ROUTES
Where cocaine and opiates come from and where they go
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
United States
 -Cocaine market worth Dollars 15bn-Dollars 17.5bn a year: consumption
  150-175 tonnes at street price of Dollars 100 a gram.
 -New forms of heroin show up as Colombian cartels diversify; heroin
  fetches wholesale price of Dollars 180,000 to Dollars 200,000 per
  kilo, up to 10 times cocaine price.
 -Heroin purity on streets rises 600 per cent since 1981; street price
  drops 25 per cent from 1988 to 1992.
 -Some Dollars 100bn-Dollars 200bn a year of drugs money laundered in
  US, the world's principal centre for money laundering.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mexico, Central and South America
 -Colombia's Cali cartel may control more than 70 per cent of world
  cocaine business.
 -Sixty per cent of world cocaine now passes through Mexico as
  interdiction deters formerly favoured Florida and Caribbean routes.
 -Peru responsible for cultivation of about 60 per cent of world coca,
  Bolivia 21 per cent, Colombia 18 per cent.
 -Potential cocaine production rises from 840-1,040 tonnes in 1988 to
  955-1,165 tonnes in 1992.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Europe
 -Heroin smuggling increases through eastern Europe as turmoil in
  wake of turmoil in former Yugoslavia.
 -Europe becomes a more attractive target for cocaine traffickers as
  prices rise above those in US and EC border controls are reduced.
 -Seizure in 1992 of a tonne of cocaine on Finnish border shows that
  cartels are seeking foothold in Russia.
 -Spain now main European gateway for cocaine, with an estimated 55 per
  cent flowing through Iberian peninsula.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Asia and Africa
 -Sixty per cent of world opium is cultivated in Burma, which doubled
  output since 1988.
 -China now thought to be second only to Thailand as most important
  route for Golden Triangle heroin; opium produced in 15 of China's 22
  provinces.
 -Heroin cultivation and trafficking now rising in former Soviet
  republics of central Asia.
 -Nigerian cartels seek to control heroin trafficking as country's
  importance grows as transit country.
