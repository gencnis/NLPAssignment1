<P>
A festering scandal over illicit arms sent from Israel to Antigua last year and 
then mysteriously transshipped to the Colombian drug cartel has embarrassed 
Washington and Jerusalem and may bring down the corruption-ridden, family-ruled 
government of this Caribbean microstate. 
</P>
<P>
In the still-shadowy transaction, an illegal shipment of 100 Uzi submachine 
guns, 400 Galil assault rifles and 250,000 rounds of ammunition, ostensibly 
ordered for Antigua's 70-man Defense Force, went instead to Gonzalo Rodriguez 
Gacha, one of the top three barons of the Medellin drug cartel. Rodriguez Gacha 
was shot and killed last December by Colombian police. 
</P>
<P>
A purchase order purporting to legitimize the shipment and guarantee Antigua as 
its final destination bore the name of the elder son of Prime Minister Vere C. 
Bird, 81-year-old patriarch of the scandal-prone clan that has dominated this 
two-island Caribbean nation, formally called Antigua and Barbuda, since 1951. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no such post in Antigua, the document identified the son, 
Vere Bird Jr., as "minister of national security." Despite the irregularity of 
the guarantee, the fictitious title and the disproportionate quantity of arms 
for such a small security force, Israel apparently accepted the suspect 
document in place of the customary "end user certificate" routinely required in 
government-to-government arms deals, officials here said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way in the world that letter would be accepted by a government in a 
legitimate deal," one official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said Israeli complicity was also suggested by the presence of an 
Israeli army officer who escorted the arms to Antigua but raised no objection 
when, in an evidently prearranged switch, the arms were transferred with the 
help of Antiguan customs officials to a Colombia-bound ship only hours after 
they arrived on April 24, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
A controversial Israeli entrepreneur, Maurice Sarfati -- sought by authorities 
in both Antigua and the United States after defaulting on U.S.-guaranteed loans 
of $1.3 million on a melon farm here -- and ex-Lt. Col. Yair G. Klein, a former 
anti-terrorist officer of the Israeli army who has been charged in Jerusalem 
with illegally providing military equipment and training to Colombians, are 
other key figures in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The gunshot-riddled body of a third Israeli, Arik Afek, a known Klein 
associate, was found stuffed in the trunk of a car at Miami International 
Airport last Jan. 24, and the Miami police are trying to determine whether he, 
too, was involved. 
</P>
<P>
When news of the arms scandal broke last April, following a formal diplomatic 
protest by Colombia, attention focused on Vere Jr., 53, as the key Antiguan 
official involved in engineering the scheme. His brother, Deputy Prime Minister 
Lester Bird, 52, was first to point a finger, not only implicating Vere Jr. but 
also hiring Washington lawyer Lawrence Barcella -- a former assistant U.S. 
attorney for the District of Columbia famed for tracking down rogue CIA agent 
Edwin Wilson in Libya in the early 1980s -- to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
Lester Bird's hostility toward Vere Jr. is of long standing. In a struggle that 
has often assumed the qualities of a melodramatic soap opera, the millionaire 
brothers, both London-trained lawyers, have been vying "like Cain and Abel," as 
Vere Jr. once put it, to succeed their faltering octogenarian father, now 
serving his sixth five-year term as prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Bird has remained largely out of the fray and out of public sight, 
shielded in recent years by his protective 27-year-old mistress, Cutie Francis, 
a powerful local businesswoman who has been at his side since she was a 
14-year-old beauty queen. 
</P>
<P>
But protests concerning the arms scandal forced "Papa" Bird, as he is known 
here, to go public last month and order an official commission of inquiry, run 
by an impartial London jurist. The commission is scheduled to open hearings 
here today. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how the inquiry turns out, all three Birds may already have suffered 
fatal political damage from the arms scandal, according to opposition 
politicians and some of their allies in the Antigua Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
"This could mean the end of the Bird dynasty," said Baldwin Spencer, opposition 
leader in the 17-member Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
John St. Luce, minister of finance and longtime Papa Bird supporter, said: 
"People think the era of the Birds is over. It's not a monarchy, not a 
dynasty." 
</P>
<P>
Unless investigators turn up an innocent explanation of Israel's role in the 
incident, Jerusalem, too, stands to suffer from the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Although Israel may not have known that the guns were destined for the drug 
cartel, "they had to know the deal was fishy, that this wasn't a legitimate 
arms deal between governments," said an official who has closely followed the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
He said that ever since part of the arms shipment was discovered on the late 
drug lord's Colombian ranch last Feb. 2, Israel has been "dragging its heels" 
and offering only token cooperation to Antiguan investigators trying to unravel 
the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this just the tip of the iceberg?" asked the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. "Were there other shipments? What else are they trying 
to cover up?" 
</P>
<P>
He said that Washington, too, should be embarrassed and added: "The U.S. 
government has shown a clear lack of interest in clarifying this scandal. We 
have a good, clear trail here that can actually be followed and perhaps open 
other trails to the narco-traffickers, yet it's not being pursued. Why?" 
</P>
<P>
A Washington congressional source familiar with details of the scandal said he 
believes the Bush Administration has so far stood aloof because it does not 
want to make diplomatic trouble for Israel or get entangled in an explosive 
internal quarrel here that might endanger agreements that permit highly 
secretive U.S. Navy and Air Force bases to operate without restriction. 
</P>
<P>
If Klein, the former Israeli army officer, can be believed, Washington may be 
covering up its own role in the affair. Klein's link to the drug lords was 
disclosed last year when a U.S. television network showed him supervising the 
arms training of men Colombian authorities identified as drug cartel assassins. 
He said a few weeks ago, in an unsworn statement, that it all began with plans 
to build a "survival school" on the island. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Klein told the Miami Herald that the deal grew out of a 1988 attempt 
to establish a base on Antigua where pro-U.S. rebel forces could be trained to 
topple former Panama strongman Manuel A. Noriega. He said he had no contact 
with U.S. officials in planning the never-activated training base but that the 
anti-Noriega Panamanians involved in the deal might have had. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department says it has expressed "concern about these arms" to 
Israel. Richard Boucher, a department spokesman, said in early May: "We are 
clearly concerned when government-licensed weapons end up in the hands of 
narcotics trafficking organizations. We urge governments involved to 
aggressively investigate the incident and take appropriate judicial action." 
</P>
<P>
Antiguan officials doubt that their commission of inquiry will get enough 
cooperation from either Jerusalem or Washington to untangle the intrigue behind 
the arms transfer. But they are confident that the involvement of local 
conspirators will be revealed.
