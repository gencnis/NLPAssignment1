A FEDERAL jury in Miami yesterday found General Manuel Antonio Noriega,
former leader of Panama, guilty on eight of ten drug trafficking and
conspiracy charges.
The verdict, after nearly five days of deliberation, means that Gen Noriega
could face up to 120 years in US jails.
The trial was the first by the US of a foreign head of government. The
general was brought to the US in chains in January 1990, after the invasion
of Panama by US forces the previous month.
For the US government, particularly for the Bush administration, the
decision to try Gen Noriega as a common criminal was a risky move. The
verdict will be widely seen as affirming Mr Bush's decision to send US
forces into Panama to topple the general.
The charges stood on a US claim that Gen Noriega had entered a conspiracy
with the Medelln cocaine cartel, based in Colombia, to use Panama as a route
for the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine to the US and as a haven
for the laundering of drug profits.
The US prosecutors portrayed the general as having sold out his country in
return for millions of dollars in bribes.
The jury agreed with the prosecution's charge that Gen Noriega had used
President Fidel Castro of Cuba to mediate in a dispute between him and the
cartel.
This verdict itself is likely to be used by supporters of a strengthened US
trade embargo against Cuba, an issue being debated in Congress.
The main charges against the general were two of racketeering. Conviction on
these two alone means he could face 40 years in jail and Dollars 500,000 in
fines.
Sentencing is due on July 10. He is expected to appeal against conviction.
The verdict came a day after the jury had pronounced itself deadlocked and
been ordered to return to deliberations by the trial judge.
The only two counts on which the jury found the general not guilty involved
smuggling of several hundred kilogrammes of cocaine on a pleasure boat.
The convictions relieve the US of the possibility of much embarrassment
arising from an acquittal. The administration might have faced questions
about why it went to so much trouble for no avail - especially as the
establishment of a democratic and anti-drug government in Panama now appears
to be in doubt.
The Bush administration has deployed vast sums to bring Gen Noriega to book
 -Dollars 164m spent on the invasion of Panama in 1989 and some Dollars 20m
on the trial.
There is little likelihood that the US will be encouraged by its success
against Gen Noriega to use the same approach again in the near future. In
pursuing its claims against Colonel Muammer Gadaffi of Libya, for example,
the administration has preferred to work through the UN.
