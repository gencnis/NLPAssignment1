The Justice Department moved Tuesday to obtain records from 173 banks on 
hundreds of accounts in which Colombian drug kingpins allegedly deposited 
nearly $400 million from selling cocaine in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Department attorneys, seeking clues to complex money-laundering operations of 
the Medellin cartel, obtained federal court orders requiring the banks and 
other financial institutions to turn over information from 754 suspect 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The court orders require the banks to freeze three-quarters of the accounts -- 
the first step toward seizing any remaining deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady characterized the move as "one of the most 
significant law enforcement undertakings involving bank account seizures in 
U.S. history." 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said the tactic is designed "to lift the veil of 
secrecy over the financial network of these narco-terrorists." He described 
money as "the drug-traffickers' lifeblood" and said: "If we can seize it or 
disrupt its flow, we can strangle their operations." 
</P>
<P>
However, the prospect of recovering substantial amounts directly from the 
accounts is "remote," said Peter G. Djinis, a trial attorney in the Justice 
Department's narcotics section who has been involved in the crackdown from the 
outset. 
</P>
<P>
That is because most of the funds, which totaled an estimated $400 million in 
early 1989, probably have been moved elsewhere since then or spent on the 
cartel's operations in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the 754 accounts are spread across 22 states, including 
California, as well as the District of Columbia. They are held in many of the 
nation's largest financial institutions, including the Bank of America and 
Security Pacific National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials stressed, however, that there is no indication that any of the 
173 banks knew about the true source of the funds in the accounts. "There is no 
information that the banks are anything other than unwitting service 
providers," said David Runkel, Thornburgh's chief spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Djinis noted that bank cooperation had led to some of the early successes of 
Operation Polar Cap, the government's crackdown on drug money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
He said the real value of the court orders -- the latest phase of the Operation 
Polar Cap money-laundering crackdown -- will come from helping the government 
to obtain details about laundering operations and to trace the current location 
of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, we have been able to trace cash proceeds directly from 
cocaine and crack sales on the streets of American cities to foreign bank 
accounts owned by the Medellin cartel," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
The interest in the bank records grew out of the March 6, 1989, indictment of 
four Medellin cartel members -- Pablo Escobar, Jorge Ochoa, Gustavo Gaviria and 
Geraldo Moncada -- and others on charges of importing tons of cocaine and 
marijuana into the United States from Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment led to the discovery that $1.2 billion in drug sale profits had 
been laundered, mainly through New York banks into foreign accounts controlled 
by the cartel, mostly in Panama, Uruguay and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh and Brady, in a joint statement, said Tuesday's action resulted from 
"an unprecedented level of cooperation given by eight foreign governments, 
cooperation which was unheard of even a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
The eight countries were identified as Colombia, Panama, Uruguay, Luxembourg, 
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Canada and Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, after the ouster of Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega, the 
new government of Panama agreed to U.S. requests for records of bank accounts 
identified as having been used by cartel money launderers. 
</P>
<P>
Examination of those and other foreign accounts disclosed that almost $350 
million of the $1.2 billion in profits from U.S. drug sales had been 
transferred by wire back to U.S. banks, primarily in New York and Florida. An 
additional $50 million is believed never to have left U.S. accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said the cartel needs the U.S. accounts to provide working capital 
for its daily activities in America and to maintain its payroll. 
</P>
<P>
"Our ability to examine these bank records may well be the key to unlocking the 
totality of the secret financial arrangements of the cartel in the United 
States," the attorney general said. 
</P>
<P>
Djinis, the narcotics section attorney, said the cartel used imaginative covers 
for its accounts. One was maintained under the name of a 2-year-old relative of 
a cartel member. 
</P>
<P>
Despite attempts to disguise the real ownership, however, the accounts 
frequently contain a common element, such as an address or a telephone or 
facsimile machine number linked to cartel members, the Justice Department said 
in papers filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The records, Djinis said, are expected to provide "a really rare look into 
their underground use of accounts in this country. We think this is going to 
point fingers in a lot of directions." 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators believe the cartel has purchased real estate in the 
United States, something the bank records could corroborate, according to 
Djinis. Some of the funds, he said, have been used for "purchases of consumer 
goods for members of the cartel -- to fill up their living rooms." 
</P>
<P>
In California, court orders were sought for accounts held in seven banks and 
one brokerage house. They are Bank of America's offices in Los Angeles and San 
Jose, Security Pacific National Bank and Mercantile National Bank in Los 
Angeles, Foothill Independent Bank in Glendora, Merrill Lynch in San Diego and 
Wells Fargo Bank and Bank of the Orient in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for several of the institutions said they will cooperate with 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"Like other banks, we are called on frequently to cooperate in law enforcement 
investigations, and we'll do that in this case," said Peter Magnani, a 
spokesman for the Bank of America in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Kellogg, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, noted that the bank had helped 
start Operation Polar Cap by reporting to authorities unusually large deposits 
by firms found to be operating as launderers. "We are obviously going to 
cooperate," she said.
