Mr Louis Freeh, the FBI director who arrived in Moscow yesterday as part of
a central and East european tour, said the mounting crime wave in Russia
posed 'common threats' to all.
In an interview with NBC television, he repeated a warning first made in the
US that there was a threat of large-scale theft of nuclear materials inside
Russia.
Mr Freeh, who today opens the FBI's first office in Moscow, was challenged
over a suggestion by Russia's counter-intelligence chief, Mr Sergei
Stepashin, that he had no firm evidence to support these fears.
Mr Freeh, who is to meet Mr Stepashin, conceded no significant cases had yet
come to light, but he cited the finding of some enriched weapons-grade
uranium in Stuttgart, Germany, as indicative of a very serious threat.
Mr Freeh arrived in Moscow from Kiev where he signed a communique on
co-operation between the law-enforcement agencies of Ukraine and the US. Mr
Freeh said Ukraine was becoming a main transit zone from Asia to western
Europe in the multi-billion-dollar international drugs trade. 'There is
concern that what we call in international narcotics enforcement, the Balkan
route, from Turkey, Bulgaria, Austria to the west, may be moving north and
using Ukraine as a transit point,' Mr Freeh said.
Russia's deputy interior minister, Mr Mikhail Yegorov, who met Mr Freeh at
the airport, said last month that the Mafia had declared war on the state.
His ministry registered five crime-related bombings a day, while the number
of kidnappings in Moscow alone had soared to 118 in the first six months of
this year from 16 in 1993.
President Boris Yeltsin has ordered a crackdown against Mafia-style gangs.
Yet Mr Yeltsin's decree, which gives police greater powers to hold suspects
and to investigate bank accounts, was highly controversial. Parliament's
lower house said it violated the constitution.
Mr Freeh made it clear that he saw the burgeoning organised crime wave in
Russia as being as much a threat to the US and the west as to Russia itself.
He cited the recent example of Russian organised gangs working with the
Italian Mafia to funnel a big drug consignment into the US.
'We have to go where the crime is . . and not do what we did with respect to
Italian organised crime and that was wait for 50 years before we got
involved,' Mr Freeh said.
