With Spain as their Continental base, Colombian drug lords have gone to sea to 
supply a rich new cocaine market in Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish and foreign enforcement officials believe that each week more than a 
ton of South American cocaine is shipped to Western Europe, most of it secreted 
in the avalanche of legitimate freight bound for European ports. 
</P>
<P>
"Increasingly, we get reliable reports of ships leaving South America with 
shipments, but they are hard to keep track of once they are at sea," said one 
officer who collects intelligence on the movement of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Freighters unload container cargo at nearly two dozen ports in Spain alone, 
where police made two-thirds of Europe's cocaine seizures last year. That is 
only the tip of the iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
Booming Europe, riding the crest of unprecedented prosperity, lives on 
cross-border trade now and plans to eliminate all internal frontiers by the end 
of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The volume of sea trade is breathtaking. The Dutch port of Rotterdam, for 
example, handled more than 2 million containers last year. And in Europe, as in 
the United States, only about 5% of freight is physically inspected by customs 
agents. "To do much more would paralyze everything," said the officer. 
</P>
<P>
Although small shipments of cocaine reach Europe by commercial planes, or on 
speedboats that load from ships offshore, the new reliance on merchant ships is 
a function of geography and a hungry new market: Europe is too far from South 
America to allow smuggling by the light planes that litter American skies. 
Quickening European demand for cocaine has mushroomed beyond the capacity of 
small shipments to supply it, or of police to control it. 
</P>
<P>
"Even serious enforcement hasn't scared these people away. Spain is still the 
European headquarters for the Colombia cartel," said David G. Herrera, the Los 
Angeles native who heads the Madrid office of the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say Colombian drug families began targeting Europe in the early 
1980s, when it became clear to them that the U.S. market was becoming 
saturated. A kilo of cocaine that cost $68,000 wholesale in Los Angeles in 
1981, Herrera notes, is now $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Spain was the initial European cocaine target because of its historic links to 
Latin America, and a common language. Latin Americans, from students to 
tourists to drug dealers, tend to feel at home in Spain. And they can visit 
without visas. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors in 1984 included cocaine kingpins Jorge Luis Ochoa and Jose Mata, who 
apparently came to set up initial European networks. Spanish police arrested 
Ochoa at U.S. request, but a court ordered him extradited to Colombia, where he 
was soon released. He is now high on the Colombian government's most-wanted 
list. 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, with Latin American couriers and salespeople now firmly 
established in almost all countries, in big cities and small, Europe is 
learning firsthand what cocaine costs. Seizures across Europe are 30 times 
higher than they were in 1980, according to Interpol, but are still modest by 
comparison to the United States, where recent seizures have been measured by 
the ton. 
</P>
<P>
Crack, for example, is still a stranger to Europe, but only because the street 
price is too high to make it profitable, specialists say. Increased supply is 
driving prices down, though, and police recently made Europe's first crack 
arrests in England's Jamaican community. 
</P>
<P>
In Spain, there is also nascent narco-violence. Customs inspector Luis Vidal 
Rocha became the first Spanish government fatality last summer when the boat he 
was chasing smugglers in crashed, and last month three explosions at Spanish 
government offices and near a consul's car in the Netherlands were thought to 
have been drug-related. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Spanish police seized 200 kilos of cocaine impregnated into a 
seaborne shipment of Peruvian ponchos. Earlier this year, they found 300 kilos 
in a shipment of 30,000 Colombian coconuts. Last year, seizures included a 
record 1,000 kilos that had been shipped to a port near the French border, and 
another 562 kilos in Barcelona. A kilo is 2.2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, heroin has been the drug of choice for European addicts, and the 
economic mainstay of criminal gangs that control it. Trade is still brisk. In 
another raid on a busy weekend, Spanish police seized 109 kilos of Turkish 
heroin in southern Spain and arrested two Turks and a British woman. There was 
speculation in the aftermath that the heroin might have been bound for the 
United States. Spain got 479 of the 3,100 kilos of heroin seized in Europe last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"Heroin has peaked here and in the rest of Europe. People know it kills, and 
they are afraid of AIDS. Use of cocaine, by contrast, is increasing quickly," 
said Miguel Solans, a 44-year-old attorney who is national coordinator of the 
Spanish government's quickening war against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Spanish police seized 114 kilos of cocaine. By 1985, the total was 303 
kilos, according to Solans. But shipments remained relatively small and 
airborne until recently: In 1987, a single seizure of 77 kilos was a landmark. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, European police seized 5,500 kilos. Spanish authorities confiscated 
3,461 kilos of the total, more than half of it from ships' cargo. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Spain is joining with Italy and the United States to aid Colombia, Peru 
and Bolivia, the countries where cocaine is born. At the same time, Spanish, 
French and other European officials are seeking ways to short-circuit the 
laundering of drug money throughout Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
It is a familiar story, counted in the billions of dollars, specialists say. 
Amid an expanding flow, cocaine has already bought not only bulging bank 
accounts in big European countries and such close-mouthed enclaves as Andorra 
and Gibraltar, it has also financed major real estate and commercial 
investments in Spain's Costa del Sol and the French and Italian Rivieras.
