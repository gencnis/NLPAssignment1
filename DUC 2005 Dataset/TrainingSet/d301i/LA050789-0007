Operation Pisces, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration's huge, two-year 
undercover effort, was an intelligence coup that revealed the inner workings of 
the drug trade from Colombia to the United States. When the case ended in 1987, 
officials had arrested 220 drug dealers and seized $28 million in cash and 
assets and more than 11,000 pounds of cocaine in Southern California. Here is 
an illustration of the flow of drugs and money between Colombia and Los 
Angeles, and some of the main players.
