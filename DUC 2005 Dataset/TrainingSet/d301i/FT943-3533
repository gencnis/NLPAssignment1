Italian police yesterday said they had broken up a criminal organisation
based in Bari capable of smuggling up to 5,000 illegal immigrants a month
into the country via the coastline of the Puglia region, on the Adriatic
coast. This is the largest immigration ring uncovered and highlights the
involvement of organised crime in this increasingly profitable business.
More than 20 people were arrested, including Italian nationals, Slavs and
North Africans. In addition to being charged with bringing people illegally
into Italy, they were accused of organising prostitution and providing false
documentation.
The Italian authorities are showing increasing concern over the import of
prostitutes. Prostitution has been one of the main activities unaffected by
the two-year-long recession. But with the economy beginning to recover, the
authorities are also anxious to cut-off a new flow of hopeful job seekers.
The main problem is Albania. During the summer more than 200 Albanians a
week are believed to have entered the country illegally via the Puglian
coast.
