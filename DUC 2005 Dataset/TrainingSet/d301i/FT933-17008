in law enforcement agencies

GOADED by the murder in May of a Roman Catholic cardinal, the Mexican
government has recently launched a high-profile clampdown on corruption in
the police force and the attorney-general's office.
In two months, Mr Jorge Carpizo, the respected attorney-general, has
arrested or dismissed scores of high-ranking police officers, set up an
elite anti-drug police unit, and thrown in jail leaders of the notorious
Sinaloa drug cartel.
This came after President Carlos Salinas had vowed the killers of Cardinal
Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo would be caught and punished.
The government's moves against corruption are at least partly aimed at
satisfying outraged domestic and international opinion. The murder of the
cardinal, by presumed drug traffickers, sparked a fury unmatched by any
other act of violence in Mexico's recent history, and threatened to damage
the president's domestic standing.
In the US, Mexico's attempts to project itself as a modernising, progressive
country took a battering. Stories of shoot-outs in the country's second
largest airport, and tunnels dug for drug traffickers between the US and
Mexico, dominated coverage of the country, and fuelled concerns over the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
But, while the anti-corruption measures have helped the government regain
the initiative after Cardinal Posadas was murdered, their effectiveness has
been widely questioned. Corruption is so much a part of Mexico's police
force - from everyday bribes by motorists to protection money from drug
gangs - that until now all reforms aimed at weeding it out have failed.
The previous attorney-general, Mr Ignacio Morales Lechuga, now ambassador in
Paris, was once hailed as a moderniser, and he too replaced corrupt
officials with what was meant to be a new breed of clean lawyers. Now many
of these officials, such as Mr Rodrigo Esparza, former chief of federal
police in the west coast state of Sinaloa, have been fired after suspected
involvement with drugs.
The centrepiece of the latest initiatives against drug trafficking is the
creation of the National Institute to Combat Drugs as an autonomous agency.
Modelled on the US Drug Enforcement Agency, the institute will lead
investigations of the drug trade, arms trafficking and money laundering,
create an intelligence system and run operations to intercept drug
traffickers and shipments.
The Salinas initiative requires an overhaul of the federal anti-narcotics
squad, notorious for corruption. The institute's charter calls for splitting
the anti-narcotics police from the attorney general's federal judicial
police.
The administration has also arrested 35 people in connection with the
shooting of Cardinal Posadas and six others. Mr Joaqun Guzman Loera,
apparently the intended target of the attack and head of the powerful
Sinaloa drug cartel, was seized in Guatemala on June 9, and brought to
Mexico.
Later, the Mexico City police chief was arrested for his role several years
ago in freeing Mr Guzman Loera after the capital's police had captured him.
The attorney-general's office (PGR) also announced the dismissal of 67
federal judicial policemen on suspicion of drug-related corruption, while at
least three judges in Sonora state are under investigation for allowing the
release of suspected drug traffickers
Despite these dramatic steps, many are sceptical that they will be
sufficient to thwart drug traffickers and their ability to corrupt those who
stand in their way.
Mr Robert Bonner, head of the DEA in the US, warmly applauds Mexico's tough
measures, but says a thorough clean-up would require 'taking on officials
who aid and abet drug trafficking'.
'The question is,' Mr Bonner says, 'how do you professionalise the PGR, how
do you develop a justice system that does not let people pay their way out,
and others who are arrested go free? . . . You cannot just remove the (drug)
leaders. We know there are relatives and others who will replace them - you
have to got to remove totally the infrastructure of the organisation.'
Mr Bonner suggests some institutional changes that might cut the incentive
to take bribes. One reform would eliminate the practice of senior police
jobs being auctioned off to the highest bidder, and another an end to the
custom of a madrina, a freelance agent who works alongside policemen, being
paid a commission of goods confiscated in police operations.
Such reforms may be in the making, and would be popular with most Mexicans,
fed up with bribing police and being victimised by gangs who enjoy police
protection. But they would also end a lucrative source of income for
government and police officials, whose basic salary is low and expectations
of wealth high.
