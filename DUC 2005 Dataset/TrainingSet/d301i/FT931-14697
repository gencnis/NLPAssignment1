THE ITALIAN authorities yest-erday achieved a breakthrough in the fight
against organised crime with the capture of Mr Salvatore 'Toto' Riina,
acknowledged to be the boss of Cosa Nostra, the umbrella organisation of the
Sicilian Mafia.
Mr Riina, who has been on the run since 1969, is wanted in connection with
some 80 killings. Police believe he was behind the assassination last year
of the two leading anti-Mafia magistrates, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo
Borsellino.
'This is an extraordinary blow (to the Mafia) and we hope this arrest will
have significant repercussions,' said Mr Nicola Mancino, the interior
minister. 'The Mafia has not been beaten but we have arrested a very
dangerous mafioso,' he added. Some 16 leading figures are still on the run.
Mr Riina's arrest exemplifies the determination of the government of Mr
Giuliano Amato to combat organised crime and break the long-standing
protection given to the Mafia by elements of the Italian state and among the
political parties.
The arrest was made in Palermo when special units of the Carabinieri stopped
a Citroen in which Mr Riina was driving with another person. Mr Riina
presented false papers but offered no resistance. In the style of a true
Mafia boss, he was unarmed.
Earlier this week, Mr Mancino told journalists his main objective this year
was the capture of Mr Riina. The fact that he was arrested in Palermo
confirmed what many Mafia experts suspected - in spite of being Italy's most
wanted criminal, he felt he had enough protection to remain in his native
Sicily. Furthermore, police had previously said they believed he had
undergone plastic surgery; but photographs showed that the 62-year-old Mafia
boss had merely aged.
Mr Giuseppe Ayala, an investigating magistrate and close friend of Falcone
and Borsellino, said: 'It is a big blow but a certain bitterness remains
given that Mr Riina was arrested in Palermo after being more than 20 years
on the run. This was not luck; but showed if you want to do something in
earnest, it can be done . . . if only it had been done earlier.'
The son of a poor smallholder, Mr Riina has been involved in organised crime
since his early teens and married into one of the traditional Mafia families
of Corleone. On the run for more than 40 years, the only time he was caught
he escaped from house arrest in 1969 near Bologna.
Nicknamed 'Toto the short', Mr Riina was first identified in 1984 as the new
head of the cupola, the council representing 14 leading Sicilian clans, by
Mr Tommaso Buscetta. Mr Buscetta was the first top member of Cosa Nostra to
break with the code of omerta (silence) and agree to turn state's evidence
after his clan had been defeated in a bloody power struggle, won by Mr Riina
and his Corleone clan.
Greater protection and incentives granted last year to repentant mafiosi -
pentiti - have encouraged more Mafia members to give evidence against their
bosses. This is believed to have played an important part in the
government's recent successes in capturing leading Mafia figures. Among
those talking under special protection is Mr Riina's former chauffeur. Mr
Riina is reported to have created many enemies by his rejection of the
traditional consensual way of dealing with the main Cosa Nostra clans.
Instead, he imposed a bloody dictatorial rule enforced by an army of some
500 gunmen.
Buoyed by the enormous profits from the international drugs trade during the
1980s, he abandoned the old policy of seeking an accommodation with the
state, escalating confrontation with schemes for promoting an independent
Sicily. The most dramatic instances of challenging the state were the
murders of Falcone and Borsellino.
These killings were the catalyst in forcing the authorities to act with
greater determination, in turn prompting more people to inform on the Mafia.
The authorities have also begun to arrest politicians in Sicily, seize
assets, disband Mafia-controlled municipalities and deploy the army in
force.
The authorities warned that Cosa Nostra might counterattack violently to
remind Italians that the organisation's fate did not depend upon the fate of
Mr Riina.
