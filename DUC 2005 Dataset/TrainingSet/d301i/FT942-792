Ecuador has been the one Andean country to enjoy relative immunity from the
attention of drugs traffickers. But the arrest last week of top executives
of the Banco de los Andes on money laundering charges has renewed concern
that the country is becoming a centre for drug traffickers seeking to
legitimise profits.
Police assert that the bank's general manager, retired rear admiral
Guillermo Duenas, as well as other executives, were involved in laundering
money from the infamous Ecuadorean drug traffickers, Reyes Magos. Four
executives have been arrested and arrest warrants have been issued for 11
others.
Funds were allegedly laundered in the Banco de los Andes - a medium-sized
retail bank - and its offshore operations in the Caribbean, as well as in
the military-owned Banco Ruminahui.
The allegations are the second stage of a case first uncovered in December
1992, which has already led to the dismissal of the general manager of Banco
Ruminahui and the subsequent capture of gang leader Jorge Hugo Reyes.
As a former military official, Duenas is likely to face trial before the
country's supreme court. In their defence, bank officials said the
allegations covered no cash, but only cheques and money transfers from
renowned international banks including Swiss Bank Corporation, Dresdner Bank
New York, Deutsche Bank, Citibank International, Bayerische Vereinsbank, and
Brown Brothers Harriman.
Despite continuing uncertainty about the extent of the scandal, investors
and traders in the financial markets have remained calm. The superintendent
of banks, Ricardo Munoz, assured the 170,000 customers of the Banco de los
Andes that the bank's liquidity was not affected by the arrests.
Accounts in Ecuador, the US and Europe allegedly containing drugs funds, and
the personal assets of the accused bank officials have been frozen for some
time. A recent agreement between the US and Ecuador allows confiscated
assets to be redistributed between the two countries.
Yet the latest scandal raises questions about controls within Ecuador's
financial system. Situated between Latin America's largest drug-producing
and exporting countries, Peru and Colombia respectively, international
observers fear Ecuador could turn into a money-laundering haven for drug
dealers.
Government officials insist that the existing legal framework is sufficient
to control money-laundering. Mr Jose Iturralde Arteaga, an official at the
Superintendency of Banks, says: 'The problem is not that we don't have
adequate laws and regulations, rather it is a lack of enforcement that
permits money-laundering in the country.'
He adds that the recently approved financial sector law grants the police
authority to search suspect financial institutions and confiscate
confidential documents. Yet critics say drug money enters the country
unchecked through any number of illegal channels. Offshore banking
operations, artisan gold trade, and falsified export/import invoicing are
some of the most common ways to launder money, besides cash purchases.
Mr Alberto Acosta, an economic analyst, estimates the amount of money
laundered in Ecuador to be around Dollars 400m annually. 'Only the flow of
narco-dollars can explain the great consumption of luxury goods in a country
in recession,' he says.
