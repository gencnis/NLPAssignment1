The wooded 2,700-acre riverfront estate of a convicted cocaine smuggler was 
seized by federal marshals Saturday in the largest land forfeiture action ever 
against a U.S. drug figure, authorities said.

James West said investigators believe Frederik Luytjes had intended to return 
to the $2.8-million Mastwood estate in the Pocono Mountain region after he 
completes his 10-year prison sentence for cocaine trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
A forfeiture complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Scranton alleged that 
Luytjes had purchased the property with cocaine profits, making it subject to 
seizure under federal drug laws.

<P>
Luytjes, 47, allegedly used his charter aircraft business, Air America Inc., to 
provide planes and recruit pilots for a smuggling operation that imported 10 
tons of Medellin cartel-supplied cocaine into the United States from Colombia 
between 1980 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
West said Mastwood represented the largest tract of land ever seized in the 
United States in a drug-related forfeiture action. The government previously 
seized about $18 million in cash and other assets from Luytjes and his 
associates.
