Plenty of couriers and a free-wheeling financial sector have turned Lagos
into world's leading source of trafficking

TO DRUG enforcement officers they are known as 'swallowers' or 'mules' and
in recent years Nigerians, who ingest condoms and balloons filled with
heroin and cocaine, have emerged as the world's leading drug traffickers.
British officials say more Nigerians were arrested in the last three years
trying to smuggle narcotics into the UK than any other nationals. And in the
US customs agents estimate that sophisticated Nigerian drug rings account
for more than 40 per cent of heroin seizures at US ports of entry.
The multi-million dollar illicit trade in drugs is tightly controlled by
Nigerians who use Lagos as a transit station and exploit the country's loose
banking system, porous borders and a police and customs force notorious for
corruption.
Hundreds of kilogrammes of Asian heroin, mostly from India, Thailand and the
Golden triangle, and cocaine from South America pass through Lagos for
storage and repackaging before onward shipment to the US and Europe. Nigeria
has also become the second largest world supplier of cannabis after Ghana,
exporting 5,940lb last year.
Last year US customs agents seized 526lb of white heroin, with a street
value of Dollars 23.9m, from Nigerian controlled smuggling operations. In
the first five months of 1992 seizures had increased to 361lb.
Officials say it is impossible to know what percentage of drugs smuggled
into Europe and the US are seized but estimates vary from 5 to 40 per cent.
For customs officers the difficulty with the Nigerian drug rings stem from
the large quantity of 'swallowers' that are used and the increasing
sophistication of the cartels.
The greatest problem, according to one drug enforcement officer, is that
western prison sentences offer no deterrent to potential smugglers.
'Five years in a western prison with three meals a day, television, the
chance to get an education and earn some pocket money is no deterrent to a
Nigerian making Dollars 30 a month who is suddenly offered Dollars 5,000 to
make a drug run,' the official said.
The 'Nigerian connection' in the international drugs trade first surfaced
around 1984-85 and has grown as the economy of the once rich oil producer
has plummeted. Nigerians have seen one of the fastest declines in living
standards, with gross domestic product per capita falling from Dollars 1,000
in 1980 to Dollars 370 in 1986.
Nigerian drug barons have also flourished in a country where it is easy to
launder drug money through the free-wheeling banking sector and where the
recently established National Drug Law Enforcement Agency is inadequately
funded. Western drug officials also say that widespread corruption in the
police force, customs service and even in the judiciary and the absence of
tough conspiracy laws has protected Nigerians from being arrested and
brought to trial.
Earlier this year Mr Frank Odita, Nigeria's police commissioner, said that
13 judges and a policeman had been implicated in the illegal release of 120
suspects awaiting trial on trafficking charges. Many were freed using forged
bail bonds and release orders.
The NDLEA itself has also faced accusations that some of its agents are
being paid off by the drug rings. Last year the agency's arrest rate fell
sharply and so far it has yet to achieve a big conviction.
Mr Adeogba admits that 'not everybody in the agency is a saint' but says
that the critical problem facing the agency has been insufficient support
for training, funding and sharing of Nigerian controlled drug assets seized
overseas. He says last year 72 per cent of the Dollars 1bn of drug related
assets seized by the US Drug Enforcement Agency were controlled by Nigerians
and that some of these funds should be given to Nigeria to help fight the
drug war.
Western donors, however, say that until the agency cleans up its record and
spends the money it does receive more efficiently, it is difficult to
justify further funding.
