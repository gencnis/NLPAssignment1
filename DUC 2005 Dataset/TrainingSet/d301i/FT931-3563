IT SEEMS that whenever there is an Italian scandal, there is a Swiss
connection.
From the Chiasso affair in the late 1970s through to the Tangentopoli affair
that is now shaking Italy's entire political system, Swiss banks always
appear in a prominent, if rather sleazy, role.
Last week yet another connection emerged when Mr Pierfrancesco Pacini
Battaglia was named as one of the main intermediaries funnelling kickbacks
from Eni, the Italian state energy group, to political parties.
Mr Pacini Battaglia, now under arrest, apparently managed his funds through
a small Geneva private bank called Banque Karfinco, of which he is a
director.
Now, however, there are signs that not only the Italians, but also the
Swiss, are tiring of what has been a mutually convenient arrangement for
decades.
Last weekend, police in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino confirmed that
Mrs Carla Del Ponte, the chief prosecutor, has been receiving special
protection for several months. She has been particularly vigorous in
investigating Mafia cases.
Later this year, the Swiss federal government plans to pass a package of
tough penal law reforms aimed at preventing criminals everywhere from using
Swiss banks.
And leaders of the Swiss financial community are urging the authorities to
accelerate appeal procedures behind which suspects have been able to hide
for years.
'The appeal process is too complicated. It is not in our interest to slow
down the process,' Mrs Gertrud Erismann of Union Bank of Switzerland says.
UBS is the other Swiss bank that has been publicly linked so far with the
political corruption scandals in Italy. Mr Silvano Larini, a close associate
of Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Italian prime minister, opened the so-called
'Protezione' account at UBS's Lugano branch in 1979.
Over the subsequent two years, Mr Roberto Calvi, then president of Banco
Ambrosiano, paid Dollars 7m (Pounds 4.9m) into it, and it is alleged that Mr
Craxi and Mr Claudio Martelli, the former justice minister, subsequently had
access to the account.
UBS was embarrassed by demands from the Geneva police last autumn for
information on the account, which were accompanied by an insistence that the
client not be informed. UBS felt obliged to appeal on behalf of the client,
even though it did not want to hinder the investigation. Geneva police have
since allowed the client to be informed and UBS has withdrawn from the
appeal.
Switzerland was slow in responding to changing international attitudes to
dirty money. In the early 1980s, Bern enraged US authorities by being less
than helpful in US demands for help in a few insider trading investigations.
In the late 1980s, the country came to be seen as a main centre for drug
money laundering, especially by the Italian Mafia. A 1989 federal
parliamentary commission accused the public prosecutor of laxity in pursuing
narcotics investigations, and a book with the cheeky title Switzerland
Washes Whiter became a best seller.
As so often though, once the Swiss decided to act, they moved quickly and
effectively. In August 1990, amendments to the penal code were passed making
it an offence for a Swiss banker knowingly to accept money that had been
made from criminal activities.
The Swiss Federal Banking Commission backed up the new laws by making clear
that it would regard the acceptance of dirty money through negligence as a
possible contravention of the banking law's stipulation that the conduct of
business be above reproach. Also, banks were henceforth obliged to know the
real beneficial owners of their accounts.
This tightening has already had a significant impact. According to one
leading Lugano banker, any Italian who reveals that he comes from southern
Italy stands little chance of opening an account in Switzerland these days.
However, it does have weaknesses. Swiss bankers point out, for example, that
many of the individuals being named in the current Italian scandal would
have been welcomed as clients because of their high standing.
Now a second reform package is on the way. Justice ministry officials say it
will make membership in a criminal organisation an offence. This is
particularly significant with respect to the Mafia and the P2 Masonic Lodge.
Switzerland has treaties of mutual assistance on criminal cases with most
countries, including Italy. However, the Swiss will only co-operate with a
foreign government if the crime being pursued is also a crime in
Switzerland. Thus, it will become easier for the Italian authorities to
pursue Mafia and P2 cases in Switzerland.
The new law will also give Swiss bankers the right, if they are suspicious
of a client, to tell the police without risking prosecution for violating
bank secrecy. This will bring an end to the potential for conflicts of
interest that tormented bankers after the 1990 reforms.
The Justice department also intends to set up a specialised office for
dealing with organised crime and to establish liaison officers abroad,
notably in Washington and at Lyons, the headquarters of Interpol.
All this does not mean that Swiss banks are going out of the financial haven
business. For Italians, or anyone else, seeking to avoid tax, it is business
as usual. Tax evasion is not a criminal offence in Switzerland.
