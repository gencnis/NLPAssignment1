FORMER Panamanian leader General Manuel Antonio Noriega's defence against
drug trafficking charges in Miami gained ground this week. A Drug
Enforcement Administration agent acknowledged that a man identified by the
prosecution as a Medelln cocaine cartel money launderer had been arrested on
the basis of information from forces commanded by Gen Noriega.
The testimony by Mr James L. Bramble, in charge of the DEA's Panama
operations from August 1982 until June 1984, raised questions about earlier
prosecution claims that Gen Noriega had protected the cartel's operations in
Panama in return for pay-offs.
Prosecutors had cited the money launderer, Mr Ramon Milian Rodriguez, as a
conduit for drug money from the US to bank accounts controlled by the cartel
in Panama. According to the DEA, Mr Milian was responsible for transferring
Dollars 200m in drug profits from the US to Panama.
Mr Bramble acknowledged that the information that led to Mr Milian's arrest
had been independently developed by Panamanian narcotics officers and passed
on to the DEA.
When Mr Milian was arrested in Florida, government agents seized Dollars
5.5m in cash, more than 61 pounds of cocaine, and a Lear jet aircraft.
In other testimony, former DEA agent Mr Arthur Sedillo, stationed in Panama
from August 1977 until August 1979, read a cable from the then-chief
administrator of the DEA, Mr Peter Bensinger, in which Mr Bensinger asked
that Gen Noriega be congratulated for his role in an 'impressive seizure' of
cocaine being smuggled to the US via Panama.
The defence, by calling current and former government officials and
requiring them to read documents they wrote on Gen Noriega's efforts in drug
law enforcement, is attempting to counter the prosecution claim that Gen
Noriega turned Panama into a haven for Colombian drug dealers.
Mr Bensinger and another former DEA chief administrator, Mr John Lawn,
argued that the kind words they may have written about Gen Noriega were
diplomatic niceties rather than statements of fact. But letters and
memoranda by Mr Sedillo and Mr Bramble also referred to co-operation between
the DEA and Panamanian forces under Gen Noriega's command.
Mr Frank Rubino, lead defence counsel, said in an interview that showing the
extent of this co-operation was a central part of the defence strategy. When
Mr Bramble has testified he is expected to be followed by another DEA agent
who worked in Panama.
Mr May and Mr Rubino expect to finish presenting their case in 4-6 weeks,
when the prosecution is expected to offer a rebuttal.
