trade in cut-price US cigarettes

ACTIVITY along the US-Canada border is increasingly reminiscent of the
rough, tough days of Prohibition. The difference is that the direction of
the illicit traffic has been reversed, and the product being smuggled is not
whisky, but cigarettes.
Cross-border smuggling has become a huge headache for Canada's tobacco
industry and for law enforcement agencies.
According to industry estimates, almost one in five cartons of cigarettes
sold in Canada has been smuggled across the border. Retailers in Quebec,
where the problem is at its worst, say they are losing more than half their
business to smugglers.
The surge in cigarette smuggling can be traced to the 'sin' taxes imposed on
tobacco.
In most provinces, smokers pay four different federal and provincial taxes.
This means a pack of 20 cigarettes costing about CDollars 6.30 (USDollars
4.85) in a Toronto drugstore will be USDollars 2.15, in a US store over the
border in Buffalo, New York.
Official figures show that domestic cigarette sales fell 26 per cent in
July, compared to a year earlier. But, as Mr Jacques LaRiviere,
vice-president of the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Council, points out:
'What has happened is not a decline in consumption. The consumer has been
looking for alternatives, and where there is demand, there develops supply.'
Many of the smuggled cigarettes meeting that demand are made in Canada
because Canadian smokers tend to prefer Canadian brands which use pure
Virginia tobacco.
Canadian cigarettes sold to some US wholesalers are being resold to
organised crime syndicates which then transport them back across the border
in small boats or under the false floors of cars and trucks.
As a result, while domestic sales have been shrinking, exports have surged
by 88 per cent to 9.7bn cigarettes in the first seven months of this year.
Once back in Canada, the cigarettes are sold tax-free in bars, shopping mall
parking lots and schools.
Prominent labels on exported cigarette packs, which warn that the contents
are not for sale in Canada, have failed to stop the trade. Manufacturers
report that a growing proportion of smuggled cigarettes come in packs that
are almost identical to those produced for the domestic market.
Greater vigilance by police and customs officials at border crossings has
been ineffective. Enforcement is complicated by the fact that much of the
traffic is channelled through Indian reserves which straddle the border and
whose inhabitants claim that outside authorities have no right to interfere.
Some in the industry say the best, and perhaps the only, way to stop the
illicit traffic would be to lighten the tax burden on tobacco. But that
appears unlikely. Hefty taxes on cigarettes are designed to discourage
smoking as well as providing revenues to the government.
But as the cross-border bootleggers proved 70 years ago, smokers and
drinkers will not easily let politicians deprive them of their pleasures.
