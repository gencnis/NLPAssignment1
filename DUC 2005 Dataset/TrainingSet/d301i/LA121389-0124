Raul Silvio Vivas, 39, was arraigned in U.S. District Court Monday on 
conspiracy and drug charges contained in separate indictments alleging that he 
and 32 other individuals and a Miami corporation ran an operation described as 
the largest of its kind ever uncovered by U.S. authorities.

U.S. District Judge William D. Keller ordered Vivas held without bail. Vivas 
was extradited from a Uruguay jail Friday and flown to Los Angeles. He had been 
in custody since Feb. 22 when, at the request of the FBI, he was arrested by 
the Uruguay National Police.
