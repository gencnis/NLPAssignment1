PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday launched a programme to tighten US
immigration controls and clamp down on smuggling rings that bring foreigners
into the country illegally.
He asked Congress for Dollars 172m to hire up to 600 more border patrol
agents and boost efforts to stop immigrant-smugglers and intercept smuggling
ships at sea.
'It's certainly plain to anybody with eyes to see that the border patrol is
drastically understaffed, breathtakingly understaffed,' Mr Clinton said.
He also called for a process of 'expedited exclusion' which would allow
officials to rule summarily on asylum requests, instead of allowing
asylum-seekers to stay for months while their cases are judged.
Anyone trying to smuggle in aliens would face anti-racketeering charges and
doubled prison sentences. In recent months, there have been a series of
attempts to land illegal immigrants by ship.
The measures have also been prompted by doubts about the effectiveness of US
consular officials in screening visa applicants for terrorist links.
There is the recent case of Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, a militant Moslem
preacher, several of whose followers have been arrested in connection with
the bombing of the World Trade Centre in New York. Sheikh Omar is in custody
awaiting deportation proceedings, although he entered the US legally on a
visa issued after a CIA review.
Mr Clinton insisted the US was not seeking to close its doors to legal
immigrants and would remain 'the world's greatest melting pot'. However, 'we
must say no to illegal immigration so we can continue to say yes to legal
immigration,' he said.
