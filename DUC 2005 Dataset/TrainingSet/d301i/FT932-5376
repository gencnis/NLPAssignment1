THE US Coast Guard intercepted two boats trying to smuggle 270 Chinese into
California yesterday, coinciding with a Chinese government statement that it
had stepped up efforts to halt illegal emigration, AP reports.
'The public security departments have stepped up efforts to track down the
criminal groups organising human smuggling and patrols at sea,' a Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
Since January authorities on both sides of the Pacific have intercepted
boats carrying about 2,500 Chinese, each of whom had paid or promised
smugglers Dollars 20,000-Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 13,000-Pounds 19,500) to get
them into the US illegally. Many others are entering overland from Mexico or
arriving at airports with false documents.
