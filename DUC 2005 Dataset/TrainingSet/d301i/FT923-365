ITALIAN and US police said yesterday they had smashed one of the world's
biggest cocaine-smuggling and money-laundering networks in a huge
international swoop that had led to the arrest of more than 200 suspects.
The 34 people arrested in Italy included two kingpins of Colombian cocaine
cartels and members of Italian Mafia families. Some 167 people were arrested
in the US, including a senior executive of Colombia's national bank.
Two people were arrested in Costa Rica and police said they had found a huge
cache of drug money in Britain.
The swoop, called Operation Green Ice, took some 10 months to plan and most
of the arrests were made last week. It was carried out jointly by Italian
police and the US Drug Enforcement Administration.
The drugs organisation used intricate methods - including bank accounts,
couriers and ships as well as dummy and real companies in many countries -
to smuggle cocaine from South America to Europe. Some of the money to pay
for the drugs was then sent back to South America via bank accounts and
companies in Austria, the US and Switzerland. Some remained in Europe.
Officials said the most significant arrest in Italy was that of Jose 'Tony
the Pope' Duran, 38. One Italian anti-Mafia official called him 'the most
important distributor in the world of cocaine for the Colombian drug
cartels'.
Mr Duran, alleged to be the head of the Pereira cartel, was arrested at a
bar in Rome last week.
UK investigators said they had arrested two men, believed to be Americans,
in the Kensington area of London last Friday and seized 43kg of cocaine with
an estimated street value of Pounds 7m during their contribution to
Operation Green Ice.
Customs officers and police also seized nearly Pounds 2.5m of what is
believed to be drug-laundered money from various locations, including a
lock-up garage in south-east London.
The men arrested in the UK were being held and questioned at an undisclosed
London location.
Mr Douglas Tweddle, chief UK customs investigator, said last night: 'This is
a major blow to the drug barons. We have managed to take a lot of money away
from them. . . it will make it very difficult for them to operate in the
future.'
