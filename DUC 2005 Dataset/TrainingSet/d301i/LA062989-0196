Cuba's interior minister, Gen. Jose Abrantes, has been fired for "great 
deficiency" in this Communist nation's first drug trafficking scandal, the 
official newspaper Granma said today. 
</P>
<P>
It said in a front-page announcement signed by President Fidel Castro that the 
Communist Party Politburo decided to name Gen. Abelardo Colome Ibarra as new 
interior minister, a job diplomats say ranks third in Cuba's power structure. 
</P>
<P>
Abrantes, a well-known figure and long-time associate of Castro and his younger 
brother, Raul, became the first high-level government casualty in the scandal 
involving top Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez, a hero of the Cuban revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Granma said the Politburo decided to fire Abrantes in view "of the great 
deficiency in the direction of the Interior Ministry in relation to the conduct 
of a group of officials who during 2 1/2 years carried out with impunity drug 
trafficking operations." 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa and six accomplices, including Interior Ministry Col. Antonio de la 
Guardia Font, have been charged with helping Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to 
smuggle six tons of cocaine into the United States between 1987 and this year 
through military air bases in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
A military court of honor earlier this week recommended that Ochoa be 
court-martialed for high treason, with all its 47 members saying he was a 
traitor and deserved death by firing squad.
