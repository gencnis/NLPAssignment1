ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;

<P>
8 SUSPECTS ENTER NOT GUILTY PLEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight people accused of fatally shooting an undercover Fullerton police officer 
during a June 21 drug sting operation pleaded not guilty Monday to charges of 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, seven men and a woman, entered the pleas during arraignment 
Monday afternoon in Downey Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
All eight were ordered back to Los Angeles County Jail, where they are being 
held without bail in connection with the June 21 killing of Officer Tommy De La 
Rosa. A preliminary hearing in the case was scheduled for Sept. 5 in Downey 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
De La Rosa, 43, was killed in an ambush as he attempted to sell $4 million 
worth of cocaine in a "reverse sting" operation. 
</P>
<P>
The eight suspects gave addresses in Orange and Los Angeles counties. Police 
said the eight, apparently not realizing De La Rosa was an undercover 
policeman, conspired to rob and kill the officer. 
</P>
<P>
Those charged are Omar Yuriar Noriega, 23; Raul Meza, 49; Jerome Leon Sanchez, 
29; Jesus Rodriguez Pena, 22; Ydalvys Escobar, 38; Luis Plantillas Benetez, 37; 
Miguel Leon Escobar, 34, and Frederico Edward Marriott.
