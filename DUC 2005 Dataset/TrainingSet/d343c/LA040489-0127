A North Hollywood makeup man was convicted today of the murders of two police 
demolitions experts who were killed when a pipe bomb exploded as they were 
trying to dismantle it. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court jury, after only hours of deliberation, found Donald Morse 
guilty of two counts each of first-degree murder and possessing explosives. 
</P>
<P>
Morse, 39, was also convicted of special circumstance allegations that would 
have qualified him for the death penalty, but the district attorney's office 
had decided not to seek a death sentence against him. Morse will be sentenced 
to a mandatory term of life in prison without parole May 3.

Detective Arleigh McCree, 46, commander of the Los Angeles Police Department's 
bomb squad, and squad veteran Ron Ball, 43, were killed Feb. 8, 1986, as they 
tried to defuse two pipe bombs found in Morse's North Hollywood garage.
