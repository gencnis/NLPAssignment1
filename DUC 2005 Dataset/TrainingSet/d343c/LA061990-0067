Officer Jim McKnight, 39, who died of a head wound at a Sacramento hospital, 
was the first West Sacramento officer killed in the line of duty since the 
city's incorporation two years ago. Police said Luis Orosco, 41, described by 
relatives as mentally handicapped, was killed after he barricaded himself in a 
back bedroom and shot it out with officers. No drugs were found in the home, 
one of four raided simultaneously. At two other locations, officers arrested 
six people, confiscated firearms and seized about a pound of cocaine.
