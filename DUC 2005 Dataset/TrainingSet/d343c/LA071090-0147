</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A television reporter told a judge the name of a confidential source today and 
was immediately freed from the jail where he had served two weeks of a 
six-month contempt-of-court sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see my wife and my son and have a pizza and beer," said KMOL 
reporter Brian Karem, moments after he was freed by Texas District Judge Pat 
Priest. 
</P>
<P>
Karem was jailed June 27 for refusing to say who arranged a telephone interview 
with jailed capital murder suspect Henry Hernandez. Hernandez and his brother, 
Julian, are charged in the March, 1989, shooting death of a San Antonio police 
officer, Gary Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Karem today identified the source as Deborah Ledesma, a cousin of the Hernandez 
brothers. 
</P>
<P>
He said he decided to reveal the name after Ledesma, who now lives in 
California, agreed to relieve him of his promise to protect her identity.
