ADULT TRIAL ORDERED FOR GIRL IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old girl was ordered Monday to be prosecuted as an adult on charges 
that she and her gang member boyfriend shot a police officer to death last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Compton Juvenile Court Judge Rose Hom found that Raylene Brooks, 17, was 
unsuitable to be prosecuted as a juvenile. The district attorney's office will 
refile the case against her in Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted as an adult, Brooks could face life in prison. Her boyfriend, 
Kirkton P. Moore, 27, faces a possible death sentence if convicted at his 
pending trial. 
</P>
<P>
The two are charged with killing Los Angeles Police Officer Daniel Pratt after 
a drive-by shooting in Southwest Los Angeles on Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
They fled Los Angeles after the shooting but surrendered to a Los Angeles 
television reporter in Las Vegas following an Oct. 23 broadcast of a segment 
about the case on the TV series "America's Most Wanted."
