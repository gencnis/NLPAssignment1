Appearing in Municipal Court for a hearing to review the status of his 
probation, Sagon Penn was ordered to find another psychological counselor after 
it was revealed that he was "suspicious" of his current therapist. 
</P>
<P>
Penn was ordered to undergo counseling as part of his probation in a 1989 case 
in which he was convicted of vandalizing a motorcycle belonging to a friend of 
his ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing a letter from Penn's psychologist, Municipal Judge William H. 
Woodward said Wednesday that there was a "doctor-patient problem." 
</P>
<P>
Saying another six months of counseling sessions would be "helpful," Woodward 
ordered Penn to return to court Dec. 20 to report on his choice of a new 
psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
Woodward said Penn could terminate his sessions with his current doctor because 
of "a certain degree of suspicion being maintained by Mr. Penn." 
</P>
<P>
Penn, 28, was acquitted in two trials of the 1985 shooting deaths of a police 
officer and a civilian ride-along. Penn, who has had a number of brushes with 
law officers since the highly publicized trials, is facing a Nov. 30 trial on a 
felony charge of altering court documents.
