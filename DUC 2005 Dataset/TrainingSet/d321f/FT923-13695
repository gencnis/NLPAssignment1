POLAND'S five-week government crisis ended yesterday as parliament approved
Ms Hanna Suchocka, a 46-year-old lawyer, as prime minister of a seven-party
coalition government.
Ms Suchocka, who is from the pro-free enterprise Democratic Union (UD)
party, won a 233-vote majority in the 460-seat lower house (the Sejm).
The coalition which sustains the government is made up of parties which
share a common past in the anti-communist Solidarity movement, which
fractured after the collapse of communist power in 1989. At its heart is an
alliance between the UD, the largest of the ex-Solidarity parties, the
pro-free market Liberal Democratic Congress, the right-wing catholic
nationalist (ZChN) party and Solidarity farmers' groups.
The new government will be opposed by the former Communist party with 60
seats and the right-wing populist Confederation for an Independent Poland
with 49 seats. But President Lech Walesa has assented to the new government,
which can also count on the votes or benevolent neutrality of several
smaller parties in the fractured parliament of 29 parties which emerged from
last October's general elections.
Ms Suchocka, Poland's first female prime minister, told parliament her
government's priorities would be to overcome the crisis in public finances,
speed privatisation, raise efficiency in the state sector of the economy and
modernise the farming sector.
She also presented her coalition cabinet, which parliament is expected to
vote on today after the candidates have been vetted by parliamentary
committees.
