MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, yesterday led a Tory offensive
against opposition proposals for constitutional change in Scotland.
He labelled Labour's plan for a devolved parliament as 'disingenuous and
devious'. He also attacked the Scottish National party's proposal for an
independent Scotland within the EC.
His remarks came as serious divisions arose among supporters of a devolved
parliament at the Scottish Constitutional Convention. The convention,
composed mainly of Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians, has been drawing
up plans for a Scottish parliament.
It proposes gender equality by placing parties under statutory obligation to
put up equal numbers of men and women.
Mr Christopher Mason was one of several Liberal Democrats, including women,
who disagreed with the proposals. He said it was 'a democratic nonsense'
that a person who received fewer votes might be elected in place of someone
with more votes because of he was the 'wrong' sex.
Mr Hurd, speaking at Renfrew near Glasgow, accused Labour of backing a
devolved parliament in order to take power in Scotland.
He said it was 'patently absurd and unfair' to 'strip the Westminster
parliament of the right to legislate on most Scottish matters, but then let
Scots MPs determine those same areas of policy for England, Wales and
Northern Ireland'.
As for the SNP's policy of independence in Europe, it was a fantasy that
'Scotland could slide out of the UK and slide simultaneously into the EC as
an equal and independent state'. It would probably have to negotiate entry
into the EC, he said.
