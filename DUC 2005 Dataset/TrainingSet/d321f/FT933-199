FT  30 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: NEC backs quota system for
women
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE leadership yesterday appealed to the party to back plans to boost the
number of women MPs.
Ms Brenda Etchells of the national executive committee put proposals to
delegates for a system whereby all-woman shortlists for parliamentary
candidates should be drawn up in 50 per cent of all winnable seats, and 50
per cent of those that become vacant when a sitting MP retires.
