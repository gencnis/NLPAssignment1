FT  30 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour women flex poll muscle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S women MPs want to use their new muscle in Westminster for a
collective assault in the forthcoming shadow cabinet elections.
With their numbers up from 21 in the last parliament to 37 today, some
members of the parliamentary women's committee believe strategic voting
could double female representation in the leadership.
Currently there are just four women occupants of the 18 elected shadow
cabinet seats, but several now say that the group could secure six or more
places if it voted strategically in next month's ballot.
A plan now being discussed informally is to create a recommended list of
women candidates. This would aim to ensure that those who might not normally
be expected to win enough votes are given substantial support by their
female colleagues.
