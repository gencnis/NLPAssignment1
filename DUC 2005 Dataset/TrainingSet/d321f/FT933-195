FT  30 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Rigid seat quotas for women are
rejected
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A MOTION calling on the party leadership to adopt a more rigid system of
quotas, with women-only shortlists in every Labour seat falling vacant, was
defeated.
But a resolution backing women-only shortlists in 50 per cent of seats
becoming vacant was carried.
Mr John Spellar, MP for Warley West, provoked an angry reaction from some
delegates when he spoke against quotas.
He said such a system would lead to the imposition of candidates on
constituencies by Labour headquarters, and warned the proposals would lead
to 'massive resentments and demoralisation in local parties.'
