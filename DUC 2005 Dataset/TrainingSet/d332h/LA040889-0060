Thomas P. Gioiosa, who once lived with Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose and 
his family, was released in Boston on $20,000 bond, after being indicted on 
charges of tax evasion and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
A five-count indictment, returned in Cincinnati, accused Gioiosa of income tax 
evasion for 1985 and 1986. It also charged that he had conspired with others to 
arrange cocaine deliveries from Florida to Cincinnati between January 1985 and 
January 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Gioiosa, 31, refused to answer when he was asked if the charges against him 
were an attempt by federal authorities to get at Rose, whose gambling 
activities are under investigation by the baseball commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, commenting on allegations that he was a heavy gambler, said: "I'm glad I 
don't lose as much as people say I lose, and I wish I won as much as people 
think I win. I keep hearing this bull about how I'm a chronic gambler or 
something. 
</P>
<P>
"What does a chronic gambler do? He's got to find a place to gamble. Well, I 
got to spring training on Feb. 1, and I went to the dog track three times in 60 
days. The dogs are really your only means of gambling in spring training. So I 
guess that's the end of that theory." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding his association with Gioiosa, Rose said he hadn't seen him in some 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where Tommy Gioiosa is. Tommy Gioiosa used to live with me when 
he was about 18 years old. I don't have any idea what he does now," Rose said. 
"Any time that someone that you know is indicted for anything . . . you're 
surprised. And I guess I'm the same. Tommy was always a nice kid to me. And I 
know his mom and dad real well." 
</P>
<P>
Gioiosa was a member of the Massasoit Community College baseball team when he 
met Rose in 1978 in Tampa, Fla. He has said he lived at Rose's home in suburban 
Cincinnati for five years until Rose and his first wife, Karolyn, were 
divorced.
