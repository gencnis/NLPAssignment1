Reuben Sturman, described in a 1986 presidential report as the world's largest 
distributor of pornography, was sentenced Monday in Cleveland, Ohio, to 10 
years in prison and fined $2.46 million for evading taxes on millions of 
dollars in income. 
</P>
<P>
Sturman, 65, who maintains a 5,610-square-foot, Tudor-style house in Van Nuys 
and another residence in the Cleveland area, was convicted Nov. 17 of failing 
to report $2.7 million in income from 1978 to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge George White continued his $1-million cash bond pending 
appeals. Sturman also is awaiting trial in federal court in Las Vegas on 
charges of racketeering and interstate transportation of obscene material. If 
convicted on those charges, he could receive 75 years in prison and a 
$22.5-million fine.
