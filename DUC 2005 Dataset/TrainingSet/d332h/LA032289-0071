EX-HOSPITAL CHIEF ADMITS TO KICKBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former administrator of a Monrovia hospital has pleaded guilty in U.S. 
District Court to accepting $6,000 in kickbacks from two doctors to allow them 
to continue managing the hospital's emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Cheshire, 46, who served as administrator of Monrovia Community Hospital 
in 1985 and 1986, also pleaded guilty to filing a fraudulent income tax return, 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Brian Hennigan said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Cheshire, who is now the administrator of Los Angeles Doctors Hospital, could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Cheshire's attorney, Ronald Nessim, said his client was approached in 1985 by 
the two doctors because they wanted him to ask the hospital's parent 
corporation, Paracelsus Health Corp., to extend their contracts and increase 
their pay. 
</P>
<P>
Nessim said Cheshire spent the money on parties to improve employee morale.
