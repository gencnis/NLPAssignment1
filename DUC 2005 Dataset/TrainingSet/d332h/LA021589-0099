NEWSWIRE: NFLPA CHIEF UPSHAW CLEARED BY PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department has closed its investigation of the National 
Football League Players Assn. and union head Gene Upshaw after finding no 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Upshaw blamed the media, primarily the Boston Globe and the Ft. Wayne (Ind.) 
Sentinel for making "reckless charges" and creating a "trial by headlines." 
</P>
<P>
The financial records of the NFLPA and Upshaw have been under review by the 
U.S. attorney's office since October. The Globe reported in September that 
Upshaw illegally used union money and tried to conceal his actions. The 
Sentinel reported in January that Upshaw was about to be indicted on tax 
evasion charges.
