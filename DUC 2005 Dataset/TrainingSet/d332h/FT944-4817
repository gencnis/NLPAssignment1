Mr Webster Hubbell, former associate attorney-general and a friend of
President Bill Clinton, pleaded guilty yesterday to charges of mail fraud
and tax evasion for overbilling his law clients. The plea bargain came on
charges brought by Mr Kenneth Starr, the special prosecutor appointed to
look into the Whitewater affair, which involves Mr and Mrs Clinton's
investment in a property venture and the failed savings and loan institution
run by their business partners.
Although Mr Hubbell is a close friend of the Clintons and a former law
partner of Mrs Hillary Clinton, the charges against him involve no evident
link to the Clintons. White House nervousness over the Whitewater affair has
risen in the last month with the prospect of further congressional hearings
when Senator Alfonse d'Amato, who has tried doggedly to find some wrongdoing
by the administration over Whitewater, takes over as chairman of the Senate
banking committee.
