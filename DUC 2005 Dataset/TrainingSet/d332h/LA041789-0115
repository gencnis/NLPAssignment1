<P>
Thomas Gioiosa, who once lived with Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose and his 
family, pleaded innocent today to federal charges of tax evasion and conspiracy 
to distribute cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Magistrate Robert Steinberg allowed Gioiosa, 31, to remain free on bond. 
If convicted, Gioiosa could face maximum penalties of 38 years in prison and $2 
million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
The five-count federal indictment accuses Gioiosa of income-tax evasion for the 
years 1985 and '86, and charges that he conspired to arrange cocaine deliveries 
from Florida to Cincinnati between January, 1985, and January, 1987.
