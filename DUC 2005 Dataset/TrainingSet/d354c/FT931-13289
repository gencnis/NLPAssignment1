A previously unknown Moslem group, the Islamic Salvation, has claimed
responsibility for yesterday's killing of one of Turkey's leading
journalists, writes John Murray Brown from Ankara.
Mr Ugur Mumcu, 50, columnist with the Istanbul daily Cumhuriyet and an
authority on Islamic and Kurdish terror groups, was killed by a car bomb
outside his home in the Turkish capital of Ankara.
Prime minister Suleyman Demirel immediately vowed to track down the killers.
