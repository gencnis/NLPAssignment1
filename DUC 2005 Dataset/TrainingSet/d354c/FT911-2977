FT  26 APR 91 / Two FT journalists die in Kuwait car blaze
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO Financial Times journalists, David Thomas, Natural Resources Editor, and
Alan Harper, staff photographer, died on Wednesday when their car was
engulfed by flames in the southern oilfields of Kuwait.
Three other people, believed to be oilfield workers travelling in two
trucks, also died in the incident. There were no witnesses.
The road from the Burgan oilfields north to Al-Ahmadi is a public highway.
It runs through some of the most fiercely blazing oil wells lit by
retreating Iraqi troops in late February.
At the point where the accident occurred the fires are particularly close to
the road. Pools of oil regularly form near the road, sometimes creating
slicks on the highway.
The two journalists were part of an FT team working in Kuwait on a major
project for the newspaper, covering the reconstruction of the country after
the Iraqi invasion.
Richard Lambert, the Editor, said: 'David and Alan represented the best
qualities of the FT - they were full of integrity, commitment and flair.
This is a terrible loss for their families and friends, and for the
newspaper.'
