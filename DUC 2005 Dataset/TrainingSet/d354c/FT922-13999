THE Mexican government has taken a small step towards reducing its grip over
the national media by announcing it will sell off two television stations
and the newspaper El Nacional.
Channels 7 and 13 have a tiny market share but they offer national
penetration and the ability to compete with Mexico's television giant,
Televisa, which has about 90 per cent of the Mexican television market.
Grupo Vargas, with more than 100,000 subscribers to its pay-as-you-view
Multivison channel, is likely to be one of the strongest bidders, given that
Televisa has been ruled out of the auction.
El Nacional, funded and owned by the government, closely follows the
official line in editorials, although of late reporting has become more
objective and readership has increased. The newspaper does not make money,
and in the absence of a buyer, the government may retain it.
Even if it is sold, the government's more indirect influence over the press
will continue. Almost all Mexican newspapers depend on government
advertising or subsidies to make money, and many journalists rely on a
monthly embute (a stipend) from the department they cover, to boost their
miserable wages. The result is self-censorship, and occasionally, more
direct government control. It is an arrangement difficult to change since it
suits both the newspaper owners and the government.
Independent newspapers and magazines have been flourishing,attracting more
readers and advertisers, but in the provinces independent journalism can be
highly dangerous. During the presidency of Mr Carlos Salinas de Gortari 17
journalists have been killed according to PEN International, usually for
upsetting local policeman, drug dealers, or caciques (local strongmen).
