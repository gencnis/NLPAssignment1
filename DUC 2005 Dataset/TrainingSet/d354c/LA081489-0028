Two Sinhalese radicals burst into the home of a prominent broadcaster and shot 
him to death near Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital, military officials said. 
Kulasiri Amaratunga, 62, chief news editor of state television, was the third 
broadcast official to be killed since late July. Officials blamed the killings 
on the People's Liberation Front, a Sinhalese group that has been waging a 
violent campaign against the government. The militants believe officials are 
too soft on minority Tamil rebels, who are fighting for an independent 
homeland. At least 38 other people died in ethnic violence in Sri Lanka over 
the weekend, officials said. Among the victims were two Buddhist monks, shot to 
death in their temple northeast of Colombo.
