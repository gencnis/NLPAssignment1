HOPES for an early end to Nicaragua's hostage crisis were hit yesterday
after a guerrilla leader issued fresh conditions for the release of 18
government officials, agencies report from Managua.
In a stand-off which reflects the bitter divisions left by the country's
brutal eight-year civil war, armed gangs of the left and right are holding
more than 40 officials, politicians and journalists at two different sites.
A group of former US-backed Contra rebels in the remote northern village of
El Zungano freed 20 of their 38 prisoners late on Sunday after talks with
envoys including an Organisation of American States representative.
Last Thursday the rebels, led by Jose Angel Talavera, alias El Chacal (The
Jackal), seized 38 government officials, soldiers and leftist Sandinista
politicians who had travelled to El Zungano to try to persuade him to lay
down his arms.
He originally demanded the firing of armed forces chief General Humberto
Ortega and presidential chief-of-staff Mr Antonio Lacayo, whom he accuses of
plotting to allow the former governing Sandinistas to continue ruling
Nicaragua despite their 1990 election defeat by President Violeta Chamorro.
On Sunday he settled for a pledge from the government to review a list of
his grievances, only to return to his original demands yesterday.
In Managua, a group of about eight pro-Sandinista gunmen retaliated on
Friday against Mr Talavera's hostage-taking by seizing the headquarters of
the conservative National Opposition Union (UNO) party, taking prisoner
Nicaragua's vice-president Virgilio Godoy and several dozen UNO leaders.
The group freed 16 prisoners at the weekend and two more yesterday. However
they also took about eight journalists hostage on Sunday.
