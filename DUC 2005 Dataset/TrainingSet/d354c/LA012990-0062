Western hostages in Lebanon are alive and well, sources in the pro-Iranian 
Hezbollah (Party of God) told a British newspaper. The Sunday Correspondent 
said sources in the Shiite Muslim group reported that British journalist John 
McCarthy and American Thomas Sutherland are being held in the basement of a 
house in the suburbs of Muslim West Beirut. Other hostages, including eight 
Americans, are also alive, the sources were quoted as saying.
