Sobering Christmas for Press: Covering dramatic world events during the 
Christmas weekend proved to be a tragic assignment for some members of the 
television press. Belgian TV journalist Dany Huwe was killed when supporters of 
deposed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu ambushed him and opened fire on his car in 
Bucharest early Monday morning. On Friday, French television correspondent 
Jean-Louis Calderon died when he was run over by a tank in Bucharest. Two other 
journalists, both Americans, were wounded in Romania on Sunday. John Tagliabue 
of the New York Times and John Daniszewski of the Associated Press were 
evacuated to Yugoslavia for treatment of bullet wounds. DANIEL CERONE
