THE UNITED Nations is pulling out of southern Sudan after a UN worker and a
foreign journalist were killed in mysterious circumstances at the weekend,
Reuter reports from Nairobi.
Mr Thomas Edval, co-ordinator of UN Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), said
yesterday relief operations near the town of Juba were closed.
The main faction of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army said on Tuesday
a splinter group had murdered a Norwegian journalist whose name it gave only
as Helge and a UN staffer from Burma named Myint Moung, and abducted two aid
workers on Sunday.
Relief workers said starving millions in the region could face imminent
death if the UN shut its operations.
The UN said an international outcry had scuttled a scheme by European
companies to dump 10m tonnes of toxic waste in Somalia. African and western
governments were outraged last month by reports that a Somali claiming to be
a government minister had signed a 20-year dumping deal.
Relief agencies said they were evacuating staff from the Somali port of
Kismayu after constant threats by gunmen trying to loot food meant for the
starving. Aid workers were said to be blockaded in a UN compound by their
own Somali guards because of disputes over money.
