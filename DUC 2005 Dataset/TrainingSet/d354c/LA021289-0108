Kuwait's government revealed Saturday that it had freed two of the 17 convicted 
terrorists whose liberty has been sought by pro-Iranian extremists holding 
Western hostages in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Salim Sabah said the two men, Abdul-Mohsen Rashash Abbas, 25, 
and Nasser Matar Dahash, 30, were released "a while ago" after they completed 
five-year prison terms for their parts in the December, 1983, bombings of the 
American and French embassies in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Sabah said the release of the men, who were deported to undisclosed 
destinations, "has nothing to do with the demands of extremist organizations." 
</P>
<P>
Abbas was identified as an Iraqi national, and Dahash as a Kuwaiti. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen Westerners, including nine Americans, are being held hostage in 
Lebanon. The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East 
correspondent for the Associated Press. He and Thomas Sutherland, 57, acting 
dean of agriculture at the American University of Beirut, were kidnaped by 
Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian extremist group that has frequently demanded the 
release of the Kuwait 17.
