THE United Nations Security Council last night threatened to reimpose
sanctions against Haiti if armed groups continued to threaten US soldiers
waiting to land.
The council said Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali should report
urgently on whether the incidents in Haiti earlier yesterday violated a July
accord providing for the restoration of democracy in Haiti.
The USS Harlan County, with about 200 US personnel on board, was blocked
from docking in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital. Foreign journalists were
beaten up and embassy personnel were turned away from the port by
protesters.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, in a statement accusing
Haitian police and military of breaking promises, later said deployment of
the troops would be delayed. The incident has added to fears among US
politicians that the troops could come under attack like the US force in
Somalia.
The military action in Haiti, sponsored by the UN and the Organisation of
American States, is aimed at restoring President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
ousted by a coup two years ago.
