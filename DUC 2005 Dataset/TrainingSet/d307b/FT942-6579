FT  30 MAY 94 / Daring vision or time bomb: A huge dam planned for Sarawak

The jungle light quickly fades. The rain pounds like a hundred machine guns
on the roof of the Long Murum longhouse. The men, descendants of Borneo's
headhunters, their arms and legs covered in tattoos, sit round a flickering
kerosene lamp. They chew betel nut and drink rice wine. Talk is of change
and development.
Here, in the heart of Sarawak, East Malaysia, plans are under way for
South-East Asia's biggest infrastructure project - a MDollars 15bn (Pounds
3.85bn) dam nearly twice the height of the Aswan dam in Egypt.
The dam, at Bakun a few miles downstream from Long Murum, will flood an area
larger than Singapore. Long Murum and 14 other tribal longhouses will
disappear. More than 8,000 tribespeople whose families have lived and hunted
in the area for generations will be resettled.
To some, Bakun is another example of Malaysia's confidence in the future and
a tribute to the daring vision of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. 'It's a
project whose time has come,' said Dr Mahathir earlier this year.
To others Bakun is an ill conceived scheme of doubtful economic merit which
could bring environmental disaster to one of the world's few remaining areas
of tropical rainforest and sound the death knell for a unique tribal
culture. 'It will be an ecological time bomb sitting right in the centre of
Borneo,' says Mr Sim Kwang Yang, a Sarawak-based opposition MP.
Bakun has been discussed for 14 years but only recently given the go-ahead
by the government. Producing 2,400MW of electricity by early next century,
the government says Bakun will not only meet the needs of Malaysia's fast
industrialising economy. It will also turn Malaysia into a regional power
exporter.
Bakun poses considerable technical challenges. It is being built at a site
more than 500km upriver from Sarawak's coast. The journey to Bakun involves
crossing a number of treacherous rapids. New roads will have to be built
through dense jungle to bring in building materials and engineering
equipment.
Taking the power out of Bakun will involve even greater difficulties. Some
of the electricity generated will go to Sarawak itself and to the
neighbouring Malaysian state of Sabah. However, the bulk of the power will
go to peninsular Malaysia, first by 670km of overhead cables within Sarawak
and then through 650km of cables under the South China Sea.
Experts point out that power transmission through such a lengthy underwater
cable has never been attempted. 'They are either being very daring or very
foolish,' said one Kuala Lumpur based energy company executive. Considerable
power loss seems inevitable.
Bakun will be a private sector project. In January this year the government
signed a memorandum of understanding giving management of Bakun to the
locally based Ekran company. The announcement was greeted with some
surprise. There was no tendering process involved.
Controlled by Mr Ting Pek Khiing, a Sarawak-based Malaysian Chinese, Ekran
was established only in 1991 and has no experience in projects of the size
of Bakun. Mr Ting, a swashbuckling entrepreneur who has made a name for
himself as a tourist resort developer, is supremely confident. 'We can build
anything on earth,' he says.
Mr Ting says between 60 and 70 per cent of financing for Bakun will be
raised from domestic sources and insists the project can be built in six
years, without federal or state funds. Ekran is widely believed to be backed
by Mr Daim Zainnudin, a former federal finance minister and an economic
adviser to the government.
Some tribespeople feel the change the dam will bring is part of an
inevitable process. 'Our ways are altering anyway,' says Mr John Bampa, who
works in the small town of Belaga, close to the Bakun site. 'As children we
were taught to hunt wild pig and fish. But the new generation have been to
school and have not been taught the old ways.'
However, many tribespeople say they have not been consulted about Bakun or
given any project details. Some reports say a series of dams are to be built
in the area. In recent years 17 technical studies have been carried out on
Bakun. A government minister told parliament this year those documents
remain classified under Malaysia's official secrets act.
Gara Jalong, one of a group of longhouse dwellers who two weeks ago tried
but failed to present a petition opposing Bakun to the Sarawak State
Assembly, says a government-appointed committee on Bakun does not represent
the tribespeople. 'Many of its members have been responsible for selling our
lands to the logging companies.'
Logging is very big business in Sarawak. In the past tribespeople who have
interfered with the activities of the logging companies have been
imprisoned. Though Malaysia says it is committed to curtailing logging it is
still by far the world's largest exporter of unprocessed tropical timber -
most of it from Sarawak.
Over the last 12 months prices of many tropical hardwoods have more than
doubled. In a 1991 review of forestry activities in Malaysia the World Bank
said Sarawak's trees were being cut at about four times the sustainable rate
 -a judgment fiercely denied by the government. Mr Abdul Taib Mahmud has
been Sarawak's chief minister since 1981. In exchange for support of Dr
Mahathir's national front coalition government, Sarawak is left largely to
govern itself.
An uncle and political rival of Mr Taib once accused the chief minister and
his political allies of controlling 30 per cent of Sarawak's timber
concessions. Two of Mr Taib's sons are among Ekran's main shareholders. Mr
James Wong, Sarawak's environment minister, also controls one of the state's
biggest timber companies.
Bakun is being built on the upper reaches of the Rejang, Malaysia's longest
river. An area of more than 80,000 hectares (200,000 acres), much of it
virgin rain forest, will be clear cut to accommodate the dam.
Environmentalists allege logging has already caused severe soil erosion.
Locals say ten years ago the Rejang's waters were clear and fish were
abundant. Now the river, nearly a mile wide in places, is a muddy brown
colour and there are few fish. Water levels fluctuate wildly.
The government seems determined that Bakun will go ahead but is waiting for
Ekran to submit an environmental impact study on the project. It has yet to
decide whether that study will be made public.
In the past Dr Mahathir has attacked both local and foreign groups that have
lobbied on behalf of native peoples: he has said such groups would prefer to
see the jungle dwellers living 'like monkeys in trees' instead of sharing in
Malaysia's development.
Lihan Ahang, a native chief at Long Murum, points to a faded black and white
photograph of his grandfather, a warrior who fought against the Brookes, the
White Rajahs of Borneo. 'We are not against development,' he says. 'But I am
sad about this project. It means giving up our lands and leaving the graves
of our ancestors. It means changing our whole way of life.'
