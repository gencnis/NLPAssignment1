ARGENTINA and Paraguay are to privatise the huge Yacyreta hydro-electric dam
being built on the Parana River that marks the frontier between the two
countries.
Presidents Juan Carlos Wasmosy of Paraguay and Carlos Menem of Argentina
said this week they would decide next month how the Dollars 8.3bn project is
to be sold off. Morgan Grenfell, the London investment bank, is to deliver a
report in November analysing the various possibilities.
Yacyreta, being built by Impregilio of Italy and Dumez of France, is the
second big hydro-electric dam to be built on the Parana, and two more are
planned.
The Dollars 15bn Brazilian-Paraguayan Itaipu dam, the largest in the world,
lies 300km upriver from Yacyreta.
Construction of the dam, in which Argentina and Paraguay have equal shares,
began in 1983 and has already consumed Dollars 6.5bn.
The project has been repeatedly delayed by Argentina's political and
economic crises. Mr Menem once called Yacyreta a 'monument to corruption'.
Yacyreta is scheduled to comes on stream in September next year. Once all 20
turbines are installed, it will generate about 40 per cent of Argentina's
electricity.
