THE Mexican government has dropped plans to build a hydroelectric dam on the
Rio Usumacinta, near the Guatemalan border.
The dam, which is opposed by environmentalists, would not be built during
the administration of President Carlos Salinas, the federal commission for
electricity said. However, the commission left open the possibility of the
dam being constructed under the next administration, which begins on
December 1 in 1994.
Environmentalists said the dam's construction might flood some of the nearby
Mayan cities, and upset the delicate ecological balance in the Lacandona
tropical rainforest.
