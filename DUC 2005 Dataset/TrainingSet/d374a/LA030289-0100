Konrad Lorenz, the Austrian scientist who won a Nobel Prize for his pioneering 
studies of human and animal behavior that led to theories of man's innate 
aggressiveness, has died at age 85. 
</P>
<P>
The Austrian Academy of Sciences said Tuesday that Lorenz died Monday night at 
his home at Altenburg, about 30 miles northeast of Vienna. The Austria Press 
Agency said he died of kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenz, considered Austria's most famous scientist, years ago could be found 
paddling in his swimming trunks among a flock of greylag geese, his favorite 
research objects. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to understand geese, you have to live with them," he would 
explain. 
</P>
<P>
He used to say the research into animal behavior that won him the Nobel Prize 
for medicine or physiology in 1973 started when he was 5, as he quacked his way 
to a relationship with a duck he had raised. 
</P>
<P>
"It was this contact which created the soil on which all my work has grown," 
said the white-haired, bearded bird lover, who gained a reputation for 
unconventional research methods and who held doctorates in medicine, zoology 
and psychology. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenz turned to research in animal behavior shortly after obtaining his 
medical degree. He had become an animal lover as a child, collecting a variety 
of pets at his expansive boyhood home outside Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 200 jackdaws, hawks, ravens, cormorants, storks and other wild birds also 
frequented the home where Lorenz returned in his old age. 
</P>
<P>
His first important findings concerned the social life of birds. Those studies 
convinced him that many aspects of bird behavior were innate and instinctive, 
rather than learned. 
</P>
<P>
His views were controversial, and they became even more so when he suggested 
that such instinctive behavior might be important in humans, too. 
</P>
<P>
One of his best-known findings was that young animals will become strongly 
attached to their biological mothers, a process known as imprinting. 
</P>
<P>
He showed that the process could be altered, however, by demonstrating that 
mallard ducklings would happily follow a human who greeted them shortly after 
birth and imitated a mother's quacking. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenz's theory of comparative ethology -- the study of animal and human 
behavior through comparative zoological methods -- linked him to the ideas of 
Charles Darwin. 
</P>
<P>
Like Darwin, he held that physical characteristics of species and hereditary 
behavior stem from trying to adjust to their surroundings to boost chances of 
the species' survival. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Vienna, the son of a surgeon, Lorenz was awarded his first doctorate in 
medicine at age 25. Further studies in zoology and psychology followed in 
Vienna and New York, culminating in a 1933 doctorate based on his research on 
the behavior of birds. 
</P>
<P>
In 1939, Lorenz was given a chair in psychology at the prestigious Immanuel 
Kant University in Koenigsberg, then a German town and today the Soviet port of 
Kaliningrad. 
</P>
<P>
His tenure there and publications during that time led in later years to 
allegations that Lorenz was a Nazi sympathizer. 
</P>
<P>
When accepting the Nobel Prize, which he shared with Karl von Frisch and 
Nikolaas Tinbergen, he apologized for a 1940 publication judged to reflect Nazi 
views of science, saying that "many highly decent scientists hoped, like I did, 
for a short time for good from National Socialism, and many quickly turned away 
from it with the same horror as I."
