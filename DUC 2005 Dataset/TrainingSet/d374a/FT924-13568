THE WINNERS of the Nobel physics and chemistry prizes, announced in
Stockholm yesterday, made discoveries which helped to uncover some of the
most fundamental processes in science.
The physics laureate, Professor Georges Charpak of France, invented the
electronic detector which is now used in all the world's 'atom smashers' to
trace the sub-atomic particles thrown off by high-energy collisions. His
multi-wire proportional chamber makes it possible to collect data 1,000
times faster than the old photographic detection methods, the Swedish
Academy of Sciences said in its citation.
Prof Charpak, 68, works at Cern, the European particle physics laboratory
near Geneva. His detector - invented in the 1960s - was used by colleagues
from Cern who won the 1984 Nobel physics prize for discovering some of the
innermost structure of matter.
Now, simpler versions of the detector are being developed for more practical
applications, for example in detecting medical X-rays.
Professor Rudolph Marcus of the US won this year's chemistry prize for 'his
theory for what is perhaps the simplest chemical elementary process: the
transfer of an electron between molecules,' the academy said.
Prof Marcus, 69, works at the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena. His theory, developed during the 1950s and 60s, has made useful
predictions in many areas of chemistry, including the way plants fix light
energy in photosynthesis and the conduction of electricity in plastics.
Some predictions conflicted with what chemists had previously expected.
These were not finally confirmed by experiment until the late 1980s.
Prof Charpak is France's ninth physics prize winner and Prof Marcus is the
39th American to win the chemistry prize. Each prize is worth about Dollars
1.2m this year.
