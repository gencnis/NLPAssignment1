FT  12 OCT 93 / World News in Brief: Briton shares Nobel Prize for Medicine
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British-born scientist Richard Roberts and US colleague Phillip Sharp shared
the SKr6.7m (Pounds 550,000) Nobel Prize for Medicine for discovering split
genes and advancing research on cancer and hereditary diseases. They
independently discovered that genes could be present in DNA not just as one
but as several separated segments. This led to the discovery of splicing -
the assembly of information from the segments.
