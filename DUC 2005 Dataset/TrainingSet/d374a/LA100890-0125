Two Americans -- one who performed the first successful kidney transplant and 
one who pioneered bone marrow transplants -- won the Nobel Prize in medicine 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph E. Murray, 71, discovered how to master the problem of organ rejection 
and, in 1954, made the first successful organ transplant, a kidney from one 
identical twin to another that functioned for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
The work of E. Donnall Thomas, 70, lessened the severe reaction that bone 
marrow transplants can cause in the recipients. His work led to a cure for 
leukemia in 50% of cases, and in 80% of childhood cases. 
</P>
<P>
"This year's laureates paved the way for transplantation in man," said the 
award citation from the Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Bone marrow transplants are now used to treat a variety of cancers and 
inherited diseases, and researchers are investigating their potential use in 
AIDS and other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
The award citation said Murray "pioneered transplantation of kidneys obtained 
from deceased persons. . . . The field was then open for transplantation of 
other organs, such as liver, pancreas and heart." 
</P>
<P>
Murray, who is affiliated with Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, was in 
San Francisco for a medical conference when he heard he had won. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about this that's marvelous is that Don and I both were in Brigham 
Hospital together," said Murray, a native of Milford, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a resident in medicine, and I was a resident in surgery. This was after 
World War II. We both started working in transplants together, but from 
different angles. It's marvelous to share it with him." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said this morning from his home in Bellevue, Wash., that he had always 
thought his work was too clinical to win the prize. 
</P>
<P>
There have been 142 medicine prizes since the award was first given in 1901. 
</P>
<P>
Americans have dominated the prize, winning or sharing it 69 times.
