North American dominance of the 1994 Nobel prizes was underlined yesterday
when two Americans and a Canadian won the awards for physics and chemistry.
The physics prize was shared by Mr Bertram Brockhouse of McMaster University
in Hamilton, Ontario, and the Mr Clifford Shull, of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, for their pioneering development of neutron
scattering techniques. Their work, carried out 40 years ago, has paved the
way for the development of new materials such as ceramic superconductors.
The chemistry prize went to Mr George Olah, of the University of Southern
California, for his contributions to carbocation chemistry. 'In simple terms
Clifford Shull has helped answer the question of where atoms 'are' and
Bertram Brockhouse the question of what atoms 'do',' said the Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences when making the SKr7m (Pounds 583,300) award. The
science academy said the work of the Hungarian-born American, Mr George
Olah, had been widely recognised among organic chemists and that his work on
carbocations - positively charged hydrocarbons - had won a prominent
position in modern textbooks. Hydrocarbons are used to make gasoline,
pharmaceuticals and plastics. Seven out of the eight Nobel prizewinners
announced so far have been North American or North America based.
