Silent, windless surges from Hurricane Gabrielle far out in the Atlantic 
whipped up huge waves, sweeping beach goers out to sea and capsizing boats from 
Maine to New York. But by late in the day, Gabrielle's winds had weakened to 65 
m.p.h. and it was downgraded to a tropical storm. Gabrielle was located 350 
miles south-southwest of Sable Island, Nova Scotia, the National Hurricane 
Center in Florida said. Earlier, at least six people were reported missing and 
three people apparently drowned in mishaps officials said were related to the 
sea swells, undertow and waves up to 15 feet high, even on some rivers. "People 
shouldn't be out there," said Jarred Randall, a Narragansett, R.I., police 
sergeant who rescued two teen-agers from the water.
