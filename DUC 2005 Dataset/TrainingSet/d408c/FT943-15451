FT  09 JUL 94 / Georgia awash after Alberto brings floods
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Muddy floodwaters cover the streets of downtown Montezuma, Georgia,
yesterday as the remnants of tropical storm Alberto drenched the state for a
fourth day, leaving damage estimated at over Dollars 100m. At least 19
people were reported to have died in Georgia and another in Alabama. The
city of Albany, 175 miles south of Atlanta along the swollen Flint River,
evacuated some 15,000 people to higher ground as coffins floated in
cemeteries. Across the US, at least 12 firefighters were reported to have
died when they were overrun by a forest fire in the Rockies about 120 miles
west of Denver.
