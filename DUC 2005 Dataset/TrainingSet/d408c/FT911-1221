THE inexperienced civilian government of Mrs Khaleda Zia yesterday called in
senior Bangladeshi army officers to help tackle the devastation caused by
last week's cyclone.
The army has ruled Bangladesh for most of its 21-year history and Mrs Zia
took office just two months ago. Although the new prime minister retains
control of the administration, steps have been initiated to 'improve
co-ordination' with senior officers.
Lt-Gen Nooruddin Khan, chief of the army staff, returned from a visit to
China over the weekend and has taken personal charge of relief and rescue
operations, although overall supervision remains with a central
co-ordination committee headed by Mrs Zia. The general has already held a
meeting with formation commanders.
By official count 125,730 people were killed and an estimated 10m left
homeless. A complete accounting of the dead is unlikely because many were
swept out to sea.
Mrs Zia yesterday told reporters that a 'master plan' for rehabilitation
work would be finalised within a couple of days and that rescue and relief
operations had now been intensified with an improvement in the weather.
In addition to the six helicopters being used by the government, 11 more
have arrived from India and other countries. However, there is now less need
for air drops of supplies as floods recede from most of the affected areas.
Since it is now possible to send medical teams to these areas, hopes are
that the much-feared epidemics will be controlled. But millions of survivors
continue to face shortages of food, drinking water and medicines so the next
few days will be crucial.
Chittagong port, which had been blocked by sunken vessels, was yesterday
declared partly open. This will enable the authorities to use the sea routes
for relief operations.
