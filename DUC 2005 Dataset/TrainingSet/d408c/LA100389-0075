Rain, floods and a tornado heaped more misery on Hugo-wrecked South Carolina on 
Monday, interrupting rebuilding efforts from the hurricane that pummeled the 
coast 12 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Relief officials deluged with clothing urged donors to send building supplies, 
food and cash. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for the people. It's terrible. It adds insult to injury," 
National Weather Service meteorologist Dick Shenot said after 2.5 inches of 
rain fell in a 24-hour period on Charleston, the town hardest hit by the 
hurricane's 135-m.p.h. winds. 
</P>
<P>
A tornado in Lebanon, about 25 miles north of Charleston, left two injured. 
About 100 people in Anderson County, 200 miles north, had to be evacuated 
because of flooding. 
</P>
<P>
The Broad and Blair rivers in Gaffney, the Congaree River in St. Matthews, the 
Waccamaw River in Conway and the Saluda River in Chappells spilled over their 
banks Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Tiger River rose 12 feet above flood stage, damaging a major telephone 
cable and knocking out long-distance service from Spartanburg to Asheville, 
N.C., said Ron Laughlin, spokesman for AT&amp;T. He had no estimate of the 
number of people affected. 
</P>
<P>
In North Carolina, also deluged by rain Monday and still recovering from Hugo, 
Monroe rescuers were looking for three people missing when a creek flooded and 
swept away their car. A fourth passenger was rescued after clinging to a downed 
tree for more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Aid from across the nation continued to pour into South Carolina. The response 
has been so overwhelming, though, that some officials do not know what to do 
with everything. 
</P>
<P>
"We have clothing backed up on us, including in boxcars that have come from the 
West Coast," Maj. Ken Bush of the Salvation Army said. "People, generally 
speaking, only want a number of clothes . . . and we've reached that certain 
amount. We're backlogged." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10 Rooms Full of Clothes 
</P>
<P>
In the fishing village of McClellanville, population 500, about 10 classrooms 
in the local school are filled "from floor to ceiling with used clothing." 
</P>
<P>
"Used clothing has almost choked us to death," said Billy Newsom of the 
American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Newsom said donations of non-perishable food items are still 
desperately needed. As cleanup efforts progress, hardware items will be in 
demand to help repair homes and businesses, Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Quayle, Vice President Dan Quayle's wife, visited the hardest-hit areas 
of South Carolina and worked briefly at a relief center Monday in Moncks 
Corner. She was expected to work in Charleston before leaving the state today. 
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Hugo slammed into South Carolina Sept. 21 with 135-m.p.h. winds, 
leaving at least 18 dead, 50,000 homeless and 270,000 jobless.
