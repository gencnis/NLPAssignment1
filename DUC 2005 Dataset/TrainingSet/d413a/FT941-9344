Co-Steel, with mini-mills in Canada, the US and UK, reported an impressive
recovery in 1993 in spite of rising scrap prices.
Strengthening US markets, record production and shipments and a lower
Canadian dollar help to lift net income to CDollars 26.4m (USDollars 19.7m),
or 87 cents a share, from CDollars 3.2m, or 11 cents, in 1992 on sales of
CDollars 1.06bn, a jump of 21 per cent.
Shipments rose 6.5 per cent to 2.4m tonnes.
Fourth-quarter profit amounted to CDollars 7.4m, or 24 cents a share,
compared with CDollars 2m or 7 cents a year earlier,on sales of CDollars
280m, up 30 per cent, with higher selling prices.
The British scrap operations did well but the Sheerness mini-mill continued
to lose money because of the recession.
Co-Steel is due to start up a USDollars 300m joint venture thin-slab
mini-mill in Kentucky in 1995. It is also considering a USDollars 200m
mini-mill project in the US midwest.
