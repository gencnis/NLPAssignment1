HOPES evaporated yesterday that Nucor, the US steel producer, would salvage
part of British Steel's complex at Ravenscraig, Lanarkshire. Nucor officials
visiting Scotland told shop stewards that the plant was not suitable for its
needs, James Buxton writes.
Nucor did not rule out building a mini-mill in Britain to produce sheet
steel by the thin-slab casting process. Hunterston on the Firth of Clyde,
where British Steel has an ore handling terminal and two mothballed steel
plants using the direct reduction process, is a possible site.
Mr George Quinn, a shop steward at Ravenscraig, which is due to close in
September with the loss of 1,200 jobs, said Nucor thought the cost of
refurbishing the coke ovens and blast furnaces at Ravenscraig made its plans
unviable.
The Nucor executives are expected to meet Mr Ian Lang, Scottish Secretary,
or Mr Allan Stewart, Scottish industry minister.
