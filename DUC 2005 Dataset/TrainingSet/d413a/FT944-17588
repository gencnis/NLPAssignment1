on cheaper and cleaner smelting

At NKK's Keihin steel complex on a man-made island in Tokyo Bay, nine
researchers from seven Japanese steel companies are working on a technique
they hope will produce a cheaper, cleaner and more efficient way of making
steel.
The researchers are in the penultimate year of an eight-year project
sponsored by the Japanese government to research the commercial viability of
direct iron ore smelting, which eliminates two of the most expensive and
messy parts of steel-making.
The Japanese are one step ahead of countries such as the US and Australia in
the race to commercialise the process, according to Ken Kanamori, a senior
engineer from Nippon Steel, who is leading the project. The Japanese team
say they have successfully produced pig iron at a pilot plant built next to
a conventional blast furnace NKK shut down because of recession.
In conventional processing, a standard blast furnace requires the two raw
ingredients - coking coal and iron ore - to be processed separately before
they are put into the furnace to make molten iron. Coking coal is turned
into burnable coke by baking in ovens. Raw iron ore is converted from its
powdered state into lumps in a process called sintering. The two materials
are then transferred to the blast furnace to be melted into pig iron, which
is processed into steel.
The Japanese group has removed the need for the separate coking ovens and
sinterers by building a blast furnace with two smaller furnaces attached to
the top, one above the other. The iron ore powder is poured into the top of
the structure and passes through the two small furnaces where it is sintered
using gases generated when ordinary coal, rather than coke, is put directly
into the main chamber and burned. The iron ore passes through the two
furnaces at the top and mixes with the coal in the main furnace to produce
pig iron.
'We estimate that the cost of producing steel can be cut by around 10 per
cent using this method,' Kanamori says. He adds that coking ovens and
sinterers are the biggest investment a steel company must make. Since
Japan's top five steel makers are expecting to lose a collective Y123bn
(Pounds 779m) in the six months to September they are likely to consider the
Y15bn project (75 per cent of it from the government) as money well spent.
The pilot plant produced 500 tonnes of pig iron in a trial run earlier this
year. The test used 800 tonnes of coal against the 840 tonnes of the more
expensive coking coal normally needed to produce the same amount. The team
says the pig iron can also be fed into electric arc furnaces used by
mini-mills.
Kanamori says the quality of the pig iron is almost the same as that from a
regular blast furnace. But it is likely to take at least another 10 years
before the process is able to produce steel in large enough quantities to be
commercially viable.
