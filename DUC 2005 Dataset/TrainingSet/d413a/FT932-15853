LARMCO, the US steel group, is to build a flat-rolled steel mini-mill at its
facility in Mansfield, Ohio, the first to be announced by a US integrated
steelmaker, AP-DJ reports.
The plant would use the 'thin-slab' casting method, used by mini-mill Nucor,
that casts molten steel into two-inch slabs and then rolls it into sheet.
Armco will invest about Dollars 100m in the caster. The company is also
relocating its headquarters to Pittsburgh from Parsippany, New Jersey. Its
corporate staff of 220 will be cut by between 65 and 70.
